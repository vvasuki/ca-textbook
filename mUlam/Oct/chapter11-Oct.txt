15 spread to multiple cultures?
16
The medieval and early modern periods provide students with opportunities to
17 study the rise and fall of empires, the diffusion of religions and languages, and
18 significant movements of people, ideas, and products. Over this period, the
19 regions of the world became more and more interconnected. Although societies
20 were quite distinct from each other, there were more exchanges of people,
21 products, and ideas in every century. For this reason, world history in this period
22 can be a bewildering catalog of names, places, and events that impacted
232Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
23 individual societies, while the larger patterns that affected the world are lost. To
24 avoid this, the focus must be on questions that get at the larger world
25 geographical, historical, economic, and civic patterns. To answer these
26 questions, students study content-rich examples and case studies, rather than
27 surveying all places, names, and events superficially. Students approach history
28 not only as a body of content (such as events, people, ideas, or historical
29 accounts) to be encountered or mastered, but as an investigative discipline. They
30 analyze evidence from written and visual primary sources, supplemented by
31 secondary sources, to form historical interpretations. Both in writing and
32 speaking, they cite evidence from textual sources to support their arguments.
33
34
35
The thematic questions listed above relate to the following major changes that
took place during medieval and early modern times:
•
Long-term growth, despite some temporary dips, in the world’s population,
36 beyond any level reached in ancient times. A great increase in agricultural
37 and city-dwelling populations in the world compared to hunters and
38 gatherers, whose numbers steadily declined.
39
•
Technological advances that gave humans power to produce greater
40 amounts of food and manufactured items, allowing global population to
41 keep rising.
42
•
An increase in the interconnection and encounters between distant
43 regions of the world. Expansion of long-distance sea-going trade, as well
44 as commercial, technological, and cultural exchanges. By the first
45 millennium BCE, these networks spanned most of Afroeurasia (the huge
233Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
46 interconnected landmass that includes Africa, Europe, and Asia). In the
47 Americas, the largest networks were in Mesoamerica and the Andes
48 region of South America. After 1500 CE, a global network of
49 intercommunication emerged.
50
•
The rise of more numerous and powerful kingdoms and empires,
51 especially after 1450 CE, when gunpowder weapons became available to
52 rulers.
53
•
Increasing human impact on the natural and physical environment,
54 including the diffusion of plants, animals, and microorganisms to parts of
55 the world where they had previously been unknown.
56
One of the great historical projects of the last few decades has been to shift
57 from teaching Western Civilization, a narrative that put Western Europe at the
58 center of world events in this period, to teaching world history. Decentering
59 Europe is a complicated process, because themes, periods, narratives, and
60 terminology of historical study was originally built around Europe. For example,
61 the terms “medieval” and “early modern” were invented to divide European
62 history into eras. Neither of the meanings of “medieval” – “middle” or “backward
63 and primitive” – are useful for periodizing world history, or the histories of China,
64 India, Southeast Asia, or Mesoamerica. Students can analyze the term
65 “medieval” to uncover its Renaissance and Eurocentric biases, as a good
66 introduction to the concept of history as an interpretative discipline in which
67 historians investigate primary and secondary sources, and make interpretations
68 based on evidence.
234Attachment 1C

69
Themes and large questions offer cohesion to the world history course, but
70 students also need to investigate sources in depth. For this, a useful concept is
71 the site of encounter, a place where people from different cultures meet and
72 exchange products, ideas, and technologies. A site of encounter is a specific
73 place, such as Sicily, Quanzhou, or Tenochtitlán/Mexico City, and students
74 analyze concrete objects, such as a porcelain vase or the image of a saint,
75 exchanged or made at the site. As students investigate the exchanges that took
76 place and the interactions of merchants, bureaucrats, soldiers, and artisans at
77 the site, they learn to consider not only what was happening in one culture but
78 also how cultures influenced each other. They also gain fluency in world
79 geography through maps.
80
Although this framework covers the existing seventh grade content standards,
81 it reorganizes the units. Each of the new units has investigative focus questions
82 to guide instruction and concrete examples and case studies for in-depth
83 analysis. The new units are:
84 1. The World in 300 CE (Interconnections in Afroeurasia and Americas)
85 2. Rome and Christendom, 300 CE to 1200 (Roman Empire, Development
86
and Spread of Christianity, Medieval Europe, Sicily)
87 3. Southwestern Asia, 300 to 1200; World of Islam (Persia, Umayyad &
88 Abbasid Caliphates, Development and Spread of Islam, Sicily, Cairo)

The World in 300 CE
104 •
How interconnected were the distant regions of the world in 300 CE?
105 This unit serves an introduction to world regions and interconnections as of
106 the year 300 CE. The teacher explains that a central question of the seventh
107 grade world history course is: How did the distant regions of the world
108 become more interconnected through medieval and early modern times? In
109 this unit, they will study the interconnections of world cultures in 300 CE. The
110 world’s people were fundamentally divided into two regions: Afroeurasia or the
111 Eastern Hemisphere, and the Americas, or the Western Hemisphere. In the
112 Americas, there were many different cultures. In two areas, Mesoamerica and
113 the area along the Andean mountain spine, there were states and empires with
236Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
114 large cities supported by advanced agricultural techniques and widespread
115 regional trade. In 300 CE, the Maya were building a powerful culture of city-
116 states, and Teotihuacán in central Mexico was one of the largest cities in the
117 world. These two centers traded with each other. In the Andes region, the state
118 of Tiahuanaco extended its trade networks from modern-day Peru to Chile. While
119 these two regions were probably not in contact with each other, trade routes
120 crossed much of North and South America.
121
Within Afroeurasia, there were many distinct cultures that spoke their own
122 languages, followed distinct customs, and had little contact with other cultures.
123 However, across the center of Afroeurasia, many cultures were connected by
124 trade routes. These trade routes were across land, such as the Silk Road
125 between Central Asia and China, and across seas, such as the Indian Ocean
126 and the Mediterranean Sea. Luxury goods, such as silk from China or
127 frankincense from the Horn of Africa, traveled from merchant to merchant across
128 Afroeurasia from the Atlantic to Pacific Coasts, but the merchants themselves did
129 not travel that far. A small group of elite people (wealthy, land-owning, ruling,
130 noble, religious leaders) in each of those cultures bought imported luxury
131 products. Besides trade goods, travelers on the trade routes carried ideas and
132 technologies from one culture to other cultures. Missionaries of Buddhism and
133 Christianity spread their religious ideas. In 300 CE, the regions of Afroeurasia
134 were much more connected to each other than ever before. However, they were
135 not as connected and intertwined as they are today. In 300 CE, the most
237Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
136 important influences in each culture came from within that culture, rather than
137 from contacts with the outside world.
138
Although there were hundreds of different cultures in Afroeurasia, there were
139 four empires, states, and cultures that dominated the center of Afroeurasia.
140 These were the Roman Empire (Mediterranean Region and Europe), the
141 Sasanian Persian Empire (Southwestern Asia), Gupta Empire (South Asia), and
142 China (East Asia). Students analyze maps that show these empires across
143 Afroeurasia and trace the trade routes (on land and sea) that connected them.
144
Migrations continued to be important change factors. Along the northern edge
145 of the agricultural regions of China, India, Persia and Rome, in the steppe
146 grasslands, pastoral nomad societies moved east and west. Some formed
147 mounted warrior armies which attacked the empires of China, India, Persia, and
148 Rome and disrupted commerce on the silk roads and land trade routes across
149 Eurasia. In Oceania, Polynesian explorers used outrigger canoes and
150 navigational expertise to expand their settlement to new islands across the
151 Pacific. In Sub-Saharan Africa, Bantu-speaking farmers were expanding
152 southward and founding communities, mixing with or displacing older cattle-
153 herding and foraging populations and expanding town and trade networks.
154 Between 300 and 600 CE, the disruptions caused by the migrations and
155 attacks and the decline of some empires (such as Han China, Parthian Persia,
156 and the Western Roman Empire), made these turbulent times for many peoples
157 of the world. The number of big cities declined from an estimated 75 in 100 CE to
158 only 47 by 500 CE. But in other areas of the world, the networks of trade and
238Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
159 interconnection expanded. As trade across the Sahara increased, Ghana
160 emerged as a new commercial kingdom along the southern edge of the desert.
161 The routes expanded southward to Aksum in East Africa, which flourished as a
162 center of Indian Ocean trade. In the seventh century, a dynamic period of trade
163 and cultural interchange took hold across Afroeurasia. Trade and the spread of
164 religious ideas between societies in Afroeurasia increased again.

179 This unit builds on the sixth-grade study of Roman civilization. Even if
180 students did not study the Roman Republic in sixth grade, the seventh-grade
239Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
181 teacher should not spend time reviewing that phase of Roman history. Instead
182 the teacher should begin with the question: How did the environment and
183 technological innovations affect the growth and contraction of the Roman
184 Empire? Rome began on the Italian peninsula and spread around the
185 Mediterranean Sea. At its greatest extent, the empire stretched from Britain to
186 Egypt and from the Atlantic to Iraq. It united the entire Mediterranean region for
187 the first (and only) time. Although the Romans did conquer northwestern Europe,
188 they were more at home in the warm, dry climate around the Mediterranean Sea.
189 Geographically, northern Europe lies within the temperate climatic zone that in
190 ancient and early medieval times was heavily forested. Atlantic westerly winds
191 bring high rainfall, mostly in winter, to ocean-facing Europe. Deeper into Eurasia,
192 however, these latitudes become drier and colder. In Mediterranean Europe,
193 mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers prevail. Beginning in ancient times,
194 farmers converted forests of southern Europe into wheat fields, olive orchards,
195 and vineyards. Farming advanced more slowly in the dense woodlands and
196 marshes of the north. The California EEI lesson, “Managing Nature’s Bounty,”
197 has a map of the physical features and natural regions of Europe and lesson 4
198 explores the products of different European regions. Students analyze what
199 effect geographic location had on the Roman Empire and on the Germanic
200 peoples who lived in the northern forests beyond the Danube and Rhine rivers.
201 Students map the extent of the empire and label the most important provinces
202 (Egypt, Spain, Gaul, Greece, Syria, Palestine) and bodies of water. They also
203 examine Roman buildings and roads to see the application of the two most
240Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
204 important Roman technological innovations: the arch and cement. Studying maps
205 of roads, trade routes, and products traded within the empire shows that the
206 Roman Empire was based on a network of cities. Those cities were dependent
207 on trade with other regions of the empire. This is common today, but in the
208 ancient world, it was not.
209
The teacher does not review the Roman Republic, but begins with the Roman
210 Empire at its height, with the question: How was Rome a site of encounter? A
211 site of encounter is a place where people of different cultures meet and
212 exchange products, ideas, and technologies. At the site of encounter, new
213 products, ideas, and technologies are often created because of the exchange.
214 Rome was a multicultural empire. Romans spoke Latin, but they conquered
215 Egyptians, Greeks, Syrians, Jews, Celts and Gauls, people who spoke Greek,
216 Aramaic, and hundreds of other languages, and followed dozens of religions.
217 Roman emperors built up the city of Rome to bring together the best from their
218 empire and the world. Through studying Rome as a site of encounter, students
219 explore the character and contributions of Roman civilization at its height.
220 Residents benefited from sophisticated art, architecture, and engineering. For
221 example, the Romans constructed huge aqueducts to bring water to cities from
222 many miles away. Imports of grain and olive oil fed the city of between one and
223 two million people at its height. The city featured a Colosseum for gladiatorial
224 contests, a race track, theaters, baths (for both bathing and socializing), and
225 elegant forums with markets and law courts. Many great thinkers and writers,
226 such as the Pliny the Elder, Juvenal, Plutarch, and Virgil (or Vergil), lived and
241Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
227 wrote during the Roman Peace (Pax Romana), the two centuries of prosperity
228 that began with the reign of Augustus Caesar (27 BCE-14 CE). However, this
229 prosperity was based on riches from conquest and slave labor on large
230 agricultural estates that provided food and luxuries for the cities. Wealthy
231 Romans also purchased luxuries, such as silk from China, medicines and jewels
232 from India, and animals from sub-Saharan Africa, brought into the empire by
233 merchants on the Silk Road and other Afroeurasian trade routes.
234 Next students examine the question: How did the Roman Empire gain and
235 maintain power over people and territories? After Augustus, Rome was ruled
236 by an emperor who theoretically had total power. However, in practice, the power
237 of the emperor was limited by the lack of an effective administration, except in
238 the military. The Roman legions were the source of imperial authority. For civilian
239 government, the empire relied on attracting local elites (landowners, wealthy
240 and/or powerful people, religious leaders) to become local administrators.
241 Corruption was a huge problem, and military leaders had too much power.
242 However, the unity of Rome and the power of its culture gave many people a
243 strong reason to support the empire. Roman citizenship was initially given to
244 people from the provinces as a reward for service, for example, to retired
245 auxiliary soldiers. They and their sons then had the right to vote. Gradually,
246 everyone in the provinces gained citizenship, except for slaves. Broadening
247 citizenship was a deliberate policy of certain emperors, who believed it would
248 cause more people to support the empire and help it run smoothly. Roman laws
249 also helped solidify the empire. A body of laws was passed down through the
242Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
250 centuries and ultimately influenced legal systems in modern states such as
251 France, Italy, and Spain, as well as Latin American countries.
Grade Seven Classroom Example: The Roman Empire
To understand the Roman perspective on the empire’s power over other
people and territories, students do a close reading of an excerpt from Vergil’s
Aeneid (Book VI, lines 845-853). Mr. Taylor gives students a copy of the excerpt
with the guiding question: What did the poet Vergil think about the Roman
Empire’s power over people and territories? The handout also has a
sentence deconstruction chart for the excerpt and a source analysis template.
For the first reading, the students read the excerpt to themselves and then
discuss these questions: Did Vergil think Roman power was good or bad for
the conquered people? What words support your answer? For the second
reading, Mr. Taylor guides the students through a sentence deconstruction chart,
pointing out the parallel phrases describing the “others” (the Greeks and
Persians) and “you” (the Romans). The students also complete the source
analysis template, with information from the textbook or teacher notes. They
learn that Vergil was a Roman poet in the first century BCE. His patron was
Augustus Caesar, the founder of the Roman Empire.
The historical context for the writing of the Aeneid was the beginning of the
Roman Empire. In fact, Vergil wrote this poem to glorify the new empire and
Augustus as its leader. For the third reading, Mr. Taylor divides the students up
into pairs. Each pair marks up the text with cognitive markers and annotates it in
243Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
the margins. He then displays several of the pairs’ annotated texts on the elmo,
explains difficult points, and answers questions. For the fourth reading, students
answer text-dependent questions. For the final question, Mr. Taylor calls for an
interpretation to answer the focus question.

253 In the late second century, the Romans came up against limits. Roman
254 armies could not defeat the Persian Empire in the east, and there was little
255 reason to expand into the rural communities and forests of northeastern Europe.
256 Deprived of its income from conquest, Rome still had to defend its frontier on the
257 Rhine and Danube rivers from the Germanic peoples and its border with the
258 Persian Sasanian Empire in the east. In the third century, the emperors
259 Diocletian and Constantine separated the Roman Empire into two halves and
260 reformed the empire to focus its resources on military defense. Constantine
261 established a new capital for the Eastern Roman Empire at Byzantium, which he
262 renamed Constantinople.
263
At this point, the teacher shifts to the development of Christianity. In the early
264 years of the Roman Empire, Christianity began as a sect of Judaism in Palestine,
265 a province of the Roman Empire. The teacher focuses on the question: How did
244Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
266 the religion of Christianity develop and change over time? How did
267 Christianity spread through the empire and to other cultures? According to
268 the New Testament of the Christian Bible, Jesus, a Jewish carpenter from the
269 small Judean city of Nazareth, began to preach a message of peace and divine
270 salvation through love. He taught that God loved all his creation, regardless of
271 status or circumstance, and that humans should reflect that love in relations with
272 one another. Jesus confirmed the Jewish belief in one God, but he added the
273 promise of eternal salvation to believers. The Roman authorities in Judea
274 executed Jesus. But under the leadership of his early followers, notably Paul, a
275 Jewish scholar from Anatolia, Christians took advantage of Roman roads and
276 sea lanes to travel widely, preaching to both Jews and others. As missionaries
277 spread Christianity beyond the Jewish community, they abandoned some Jewish
278 customs, such as dietary laws, to make the new religion more accessible to non-
279 Jews. Christian communities multiplied around the Mediterranean, through
280 Persia, and into Central Asia. The church communities welcomed new converts
281 without consideration of their political or social standing, including the urban poor
282 and women. Upper class and influential Romans who converted appear to have
283 been predominantly women, and some of them assumed leadership positions.
284 Many Jews did not convert to Christianity, and Judaism and Christianity split into
285 two separate religions.
286
The Romans had an official state religion (Jupiter, Juno, deified former
287 emperors) but they allowed people they had conquered to follow other religions.
288 However, after some Jews rebelled against Roman rule, the Romans exiled
245Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
289 many Jews from Palestine, which led to the diaspora, or spreading out, of Jewish
290 communities across Afroeurasia. Christians also got into trouble with Roman
291 authorities because Christians refused to attend the official sacrifices to the
292 Roman gods. The Roman authorities sometimes persecuted Christians and
293 executed them, but at other times, Christians were left alone.
294
In the fourth century CE, Emperor Constantine legalized the religion of
295 Christianity, and soon after, it became Rome’s state religion. Constantine wanted
296 the Christian Church to unify and support the now divided Roman Empire. As it
297 became a state religion, Christianity changed. The bishops who had been
298 leaders of semi-secret, persecuted communities were now charged with
299 supporting the Roman Empire. Constantine insisted that the bishops hold a
300 council at Nicaea and agree on one set of Christian beliefs, summarized in the
301 Nicene Creed. Church leaders selected certain texts (gospels and letters) for the
302 official Christian Bible, which was translated into Latin. They organized the
303 Christian Church with a Roman structure and gave their support to Roman
304 authorities. Church leaders then vigorously tried to convert everyone to
305 Christianity. As the Western Roman Empire shrank, Christian bishops often took
306 over administration and defense of Roman cities.
307 The teacher points out that all religions change over time. In the historical
308 context of 203 CE, when Christians were sometimes persecuted by the Romans,
309 martyrs were very admired and made into saints of the early church. When
310 Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, the religion
311 changed again, and the new emphasis was on obeying Roman authorities,
246Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
312 behaving well, and converting non-believers to Christianity. The teacher
313 concludes by telling students that they will return to this question about the
314 development and changes in Christianity later in the unit.
315
Teachers now introduce students to the question: Did the Roman Empire
316 fall? In 476 CE, the empire in the west disappeared, though the eastern half
317 continued to thrive. As the Byzantine Empire, this Greek-speaking Roman state
318 survived until 1453. Students examine the evidence (from the textbook or teacher
319 notes) and form their own interpretations to answer the lesson question. They
320 examine factors that might have contributed to the collapse of western Rome:
321 declining financial resources, political corruption and insubordinate military
322 groups, excessive reliance on slave labor, depopulation from epidemics, and
323 worsening frontier assaults, as the Huns migrated westward and pushed waves
324 of Germanic tribes into the empire. By the time the Western Roman Empire
325 ended in 476 CE, it had already shrunk into a small area, a shadow of its former
326 extent. The teacher may point out that mounted warrior armies from Central
327 Eurasia caused problems for China, India, and Persia as well, and contributed to
328 a decline of trade on the silk roads and other land routes across Eurasia between
329 300 and 600 CE. The teacher has students meet together in groups to discuss
330 the question and use their notes to make a T-chart of the reasons and evidence
331 that support the “fall” of Rome, and the reasons and evidence that contradict the
332 “fall” of Rome. Then the groups evaluate the reasons and evidence and
333 formulate a one-sentence interpretation answering the question: Did the Roman
334 Empire fall? The teacher also explains that if they argue that Rome did not fall,
247Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
335 they should choose another word to characterize the end of the Western Roman
336 Empire and the transition to the Byzantine Empire in the east. After student
337 groups prepare their T-charts and write their interpretations, a student volunteer
338 from each group writes the group’s interpretation on the board. Groups share
339 their reasons and evidence for and against, as the teacher records it on a T-chart
340 on the board. Then the teacher and students review and discuss each of the
341 interpretations. The teacher instructs student groups to review and revise their
342 interpretations if necessary and identify the two pieces of evidence that best
343 support their interpretation. The teacher explains that evidence must be specific.
344 After students have selected the evidence in groups, each student writes a
345 paragraph answering the question: Did the Roman Empire fall? They must
346 include the two pieces of evidence. To support English Learners, the teacher
347 provides a paragraph frame that starts each sentence with appropriate academic
348 historical language.
349
Next students study the Byzantine Empire, with the question: How did the
350 environment and contact with other cultures affect the growth and
351 contraction of the Byzantine Empire? The Eastern Roman Empire was
352 stronger than the Western portion. It had more people, more cities, greater
353 manufacturing and commerce, more tax revenues, and more effective defenses
354 against mounted warrior attacks from the north. Its military strength and wealth
355 from the Afroeurasian luxury trade caused a flowering culture in the period
356 between 600 and 1000 CE. The Byzantine Empire, as the eastern lands became
357 known, had strong historical connections to earlier Hellenistic civilization. Its
248Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
358 language was Greek, not Latin. This state was highly centralized around its
359 capital of Constantinople and the rule of the emperor and his officials. The
360 Christian church in the Byzantine Empire was closely connected to the emperor
361 and his administration.
362 The Byzantine Empire continued the Roman Empire’s conflicts with the
363 Persians along the eastern frontier. This long conflict weakened both empires
364 and left them vulnerable when Muslim armies attacked in the mid-seventh
365 century. While Muslim Arabs conquered the Sasanid Empire, the Byzantine
366 Empire survived, but lost huge territories in North Africa and western Asia. The
367 Byzantine Empire shrank but it did not fall until 1453.
368 In the fourth and fifth centuries, the Western Roman Empire fragmented,
369 causing population to fall, cities to shrink, and agriculture to contract. As the
370 empire shrank, Germanic armies and migrants overran Europe, dividing the
371 region into small rudimentary kingdoms. The teacher begins to prepare students
372 for the question: How did the decentralized system of feudalism control
373 people but weaken state power? The teacher points out that early medieval
374 kingdoms did not have strong authority. Local leaders and landholders were
375 much more effective rulers of their small territories. In the Middle Ages, all power
376 was local, not centralized in a state. Over the next few centuries, there was little
377 trade, and most cities disappeared. In the eighth century, a Muslim dynasty
378 founded a strong state in Iberia. Charlemagne (768-814), was an exceptionally
379 strong Christian king, who temporarily united a large part of Europe in the late
380 eighth century and contributed much to the advancement of Latin literacy,
249Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
381 learning, and the arts. Students may read excerpts from Einhard’s Life of
382 Charlemagne to analyze the factors that made Charlemagne’s rule so
383 successful.
384
After Charlemagne, political order was again fragmented by Viking, Magyar,
385 and Muslim invasions. Local power, established in parts of Western Christendom
386 through feudal relations, was the key to defeating the invaders. In feudalism,
387 kings and powerful regional rulers offered protection and farm estates, or
388 manors, to less powerful knights in return for loyalty and military service. The
389 manors provided the income needed for a knight’s horses, armor, and training.
390 Knights, as lords of the manors, also controlled the serfs, peasants who were tied
391 permanently to manor and obligated to give their lord labor and crops in return for
392 security. Knights, regional lords, and aristocrats gained rights to hand down fiefs
393 to heirs. Mothers and prospective wives often exerted great influence over
394 marriages and family alliances. Gradually the elite mounted warriors began to be
395 known as nobles.
396 These nobles wanted to keep control over local areas rather than to give
397 power to the king and central government. Students learn about the conflict
398 between King John and the great nobles in England, who forced the king to grant
399 the Magna Carta. This document guaranteed trial by jury of one’s peers and the
400 concept of no taxation without representation. From this root, other medieval
401 developments in England, such as common law and Parliament, gradually limited
402 the king’s power and laid the foundations of English constitutional monarchy.
250Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
403
In addition to considering the political aspects of feudalism, students look at
404 these questions: How did the environment and technological innovations
405 affect the growth of Medieval Christendom? What impact did human
406 expansion have on the environment? In the tenth century, serfs and free
407 peasants employed new technologies, such as the moldboard plow and the
408 horse collar, to cultivate new farmland and boost agricultural production. Around
409 1000 CE, these innovations caused an agricultural revolution in Western
410 Christendom, which caused the population to increase, trade to expand, and
411 cities to grow again. In this expansion, many of the forests of northern Europe
412 were cut down, as humans used wood for heating and cooking and cleared land
413 for farming. Lessons 2 and 3 of the California EEI unit, “Managing Nature’s
414 Bounty: Feudalism in Medieval Europe,” analyze how feudal relations and the
415 manor system allocated ecosystem resources, and how physical geography
416 influenced feudal administrative positions and resource management.
417
As students return to study of Christianity, they return to the question: How
418 did the religion of Christianity develop and change over time? First, they
419 trace on a map the spread of Christianity across Europe and Afroeurasia (as far
420 east as Central Asia). In the Middle Ages, people called the Christian parts of
421 Europe “Christendom,” which shows that an important part of their identity was
422 being Christian. Since kings and states were so weak, the Church, whose
423 hierarchy of clerics extended from the Pope down to the village priest, became
424 the largest, most integrated organization in Europe. The Church followed a
425 hierarchy adopted from the Roman Empire. Missionaries spread out to convert
251Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
426 Germanic and Slavic people to Christianity. Christianity spread in Central and
427 Eastern Europe, facilitating formation of states such as Poland in 966. Although
428 most of the conversions were voluntary, some Christian kings forced people to
429 convert to Christianity, as Charlemagne did to the Saxons in early 800s. Wealthy
430 Christians donated land to monasteries, filled with monks and nuns who pledged
431 themselves to live separately from the world. These monks and nuns were the
432 only educated people, and they devoted themselves to copying Roman and
433 Christian texts. Around 900, popes began to assert their control over the church
434 hierarchy, which brought them into conflict with secular monarchs. Students learn
435 about the split between the Orthodox Church, which acknowledged the
436 leadership of the patriarch of Constantinople, and the Catholic Church, which
437 recognized the authority of the pope in Rome. Churches in Eastern Europe
438 (Russian, Greek, Serbian) followed the Orthodox or Greek Church, since
439 missionaries led by Constantinople had converted their people to Christianity.
440 Because missionaries led by Rome had converted people in Western, Central
441 and Northern Europe, these remained in “the Church,” also called the Latin
442 Church and, later, the Roman Catholic Church.

This unit examines the geography of Southwestern Asia (including the Middle
457 East), the Persian Sasanian Empire, the emergence and development of Islam,
458 the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, and the spread of Islam, and interactions
459 at three sites of encounter, Baghdad in the eighth century, Sicily in the twelfth
460 century, and Cairo in the fourteenth century. The teacher begins with introducing
461 the question: How did the environment affect the development and
462 expansion of the Persian Empire, Muslim empires, and cities? What impact
463 did this expansion have on the environment? A climatic map of Southwestern
464 Asia shows that much of this area falls within a long belt of dry country that
465 extends from the Sahara Desert to the arid lands of northern China. In lesson
466 one of the California EEI unit, “Arabic Trade Networks,” students examine the
467 physical features and natural systems of the Arabian Peninsula and the human
468 improvements to farming practices which increased supplies of food. Across this
469 dry zone, including Arabia, pastoral nomads herded camels and other animals,
253Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
470 and oasis cities sheltered farmers, artisans, and merchants. North of the Arabian
471 peninsula is the lush agricultural land of Mesopotamia and Persia. Here settled
472 farmers had supported an advanced civilization going back to ancient
473 Mesopotamia. A map of the eastern hemisphere also shows students that
474 Southwestern Asia, Persia, Arabia, the Red Sea, and the Persian (Arabian) Gulf
475 were natural channels for land and sea trade in spices, textiles, and many other
476 goods between the Indian Ocean world and the Mediterranean area. These
477 geographical factors put Southwestern Asia and Arab, Persian, and Indian
478 merchants and sailors at the center of the Afroeurasian trade networks, which
479 began to grow dynamically after the seventh century.
480 The teacher turns briefly to the Persian Sasanian Empire from 300 to 651,
481 when it was conquered by Muslim armies. The teacher reminds students that the
482 Persian Empire (under different names, which aren’t important for the students to
483 memorize) had existed from about 550 BCE and was the heir to the ancient
484 civilization of Mesopotamia. It was the most important state in Southwestern Asia
485 and Rome and the Byzantine Empire’s great rival for power in the eastern
486 Mediterranean and western Asia. In the sixth century, the Sasanians ruled an
487 empire that began at the Euphrates River and covered modern Iraq, Iran,
488 Afghanistan, and parts of central Asia. Their ruler was called by the title “King of
489 Kings.” The official religion of Persia was Zoroastrianism, but they practiced
490 religious toleration. Many Jews and Christians lived in the Persian Empire. Every
491 land trade route across central Eurasia passed through the Persian Empire, and
492 the tax income from the trade made the Persians wealthy. Continued warfare
254Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
493 against the Byzantine Empire weakened the Sasanian Persian Empire in the
494 mid-seventh century and contributed to its fall to Muslim armies.
495
The students now turn to the emergence of the religion of Islam, as they study
496 the question: How did Islam develop and change over time? How did Islam
497 spread to multiple cultures? Along with Judaism and Christianity, Islam is an
498 “Abrahamic” religion, that is, a faith built on the ancient monotheism of Abraham.
499 Beginning in 610, Muhammad (570-632 CE), a resident of the small Arabian city
500 of Mecca, preached a new vision of monotheistic faith. According to Muslim
501 tradition, Muhammad, an Arabic-speaking merchant, received revelations from
502 God, which were written down in the Qur’an. This message declared that human
503 beings must worship and live by the teachings of the one God and treat one
504 another with equality and justice. Divine salvation will come to the righteous, but
505 those who deny God, “Allah” in Arabic, will suffer damnation. God’s
506 commandments require all men and women to live virtuously by submitting to
507 Allah and following the Five Pillars. Like Christianity and unlike Judaism, there is
508 an afterlife in Islam; faithful believers are promised paradise after death. Islamic
509 teachings are set forth principally in the Qur’an and the Hadith, the sayings and
510 actions of Muhammad. These were the foundation for the Shariah, the religious
511 laws governing moral, social, and economic life. Islamic law, for example,
512 rejected the older Arabian view of women as “family property,” declaring that all
513 women and men are entitled to respect and moral self-governance, even though
514 Muslim society, like all agrarian societies of that era, remained patriarchal, that is,
515 dominated politically, socially, and culturally by men.
255Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
516
Muhammad also founded a political state in order to defend the young Muslim
517 community. He led armies of desert tribes to take over all of the Arabian
518 peninsula. After his death, the leaders of the Muslim community chose one of his
519 followers to be their new leader, with the title “caliph.” The caliphs sent armies
520 northward to conquer part of the Christian Byzantine Empire and all of the
521 Persian Sasanian Empire. As the Muslim conquests multiplied, the Umayyad
522 dynasty of caliphs ruled an empire called the Umayyad Caliphate. Muslim armies
523 continued to conquer land until by 750 CE, the Umayyad Caliphate extended
524 from Spain to northern India. Muslims did not force Christians or Jews, “people of
525 the book,” to convert, but people of other religions were sometimes forced to
526 convert. Non-Muslims had to pay a special tax to the caliphate. Gradually more
527 and more people in the caliphate converted to Islam, and Arabic, the language of
528 both the conquerors and the Qur’an, achieved gradual dominance across much
529 of Southwestern Asia (except in Persia) and North Africa. The Umayyad
530 caliphate broke into several states after 750, but most of the Middle East
531 remained unified under the caliphs of the Abbasid dynasty (751-1258) with its
532 capital in Baghdad.
533
The teacher introduces the new capital of Baghdad as the next site of
534 encounter, with the question: What were the multiple ways people of different
535 cultures interacted at sites of encounter, such as Baghdad? The teacher
536 asks students to think about what they have just studied about the spread of the
537 Muslim Empire as one way people of different cultures interact. That is, Arabs,
538 who were nomadic tribesmen from Arabia, converted to a new religion, and
256Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
539 inspired by that religion, fought wars against other cultures. One type of cultural
540 interaction is war. After the conquest, people of other cultures had to live under
541 Umayyad Muslim rule and pay special taxes if they belonged to another religion.
542 This type of cultural interaction is called coexistence in communities. Another
543 type is adoption and adaptation. Some of these conquered people adopted the
544 new religion for various reasons, such as religious conversion, access to political
545 power, and socio-economic advantages. As they converted, they changed their
546 names, their social identity, and associated with Muslims in their area, rather
547 than with their home group of Jews, Christians, or others. Over time, they
548 adopted more of Arab culture as well. However, as they adopted the Muslim
549 religion and Arab culture, they also adapted religious and cultural practices to
550 accommodate local customs. For example, the custom of secluding elite women
551 inside a special part of the house and only allowing them to go out when their
552 hair and most of their bodies were covered predates the religion of Islam. It was
553 actually a Persian and Mediterranean (and ancient Athenian) custom. Before
554 Islam, Arabian women were not confined to the household. The Persians and
555 Mediterranean people who converted to Islam adapted social practices to include
556 their custom. This is just one example of the cultural adaptation process.
557
Under the Abbasids, Baghdad grew from an insignificant village to one of the
558 leading cities of the world. The city’s culture was a mix of Arab, Persian, Indian,
559 Turkish, and Central Asian culture. The Abbasids encouraged the growth of
560 learning and borrowing from Greek, Hellenistic, and Indian science and medicine.
561 They built schools and libraries, translated and preserved Greek philosophic,
257Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
562 scientific, and medical texts, and supported scientists who expanded that
563 knowledge. In Baghdad and other Muslim-ruled cities, Muslim, Christian, and
564 Jewish scholars collaborated to study ancient Greek, Persian, and Indian
565 writings, forging and widely disseminating a more advanced synthesis of
566 philosophical, scientific, mathematical, geographic, artistic, medical, and literary
567 knowledge. To investigate the question: What did the interaction of Arab,
568 Persian, Greek, Hellenistic, and Indian ideas and technologies at Baghdad
569 (and the Abbasid caliphate) produce? students analyze visuals of libraries,
570 schools, and scientific drawings from Muslim manuscripts, the circulation of
571 “Arabic” numerals, and words of Arabic origin (such as algebra, candy, mattress,
572 rice). The teacher sets up a gallery walk and provides student groups with a
573 source analysis template. The template asks students to record source
574 information, describe the contents of the visual, and cite evidence from the visual
575 that answers the lesson question. Students share some of their observations and
576 answers to the whole class, as the teacher lists the products on the board. Then
577 the teacher guides students through developing a one-sentence interpretation
578 that answers the question. The students then return to their groups to discuss the
579 evidence they have gathered. The teacher stresses that they should choose the
580 best two pieces of evidence from their gallery walk. The group chooses two
581 pieces of evidence and each group member completes an evidence analysis
582 chart (with columns for evidence, meaning, significance, and source). The
583 teacher displays several group charts on the elmo, clears up any
258Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
584 misconceptions, and showcases examples of good evidence choices, analyses,
585 and citations.
586
After 900, the Abbasid Empire began to fragment into many smaller states.
587 However, the common knowledge of Arabic, the pilgrimage to Mecca, and
588 extensive trade and travel unified the Muslim world. Islam continued to spread,
589 sometimes by conquest, but also by the missionary work of Sufis and traveling
590 Muslim merchants. Sufi saints and teachers combined local and Islamic
591 traditions, and inspired common people on the frontier areas of the Muslim world
592 – east Africa, Southeast Asia, and India – to convert.

594 The teacher now tells students that they are going to look at Western
595 Christendom and the World of Islam together through studying the site of
596 encounter in twelfth-century Norman Sicily, using the History Blueprint’s Sites of
259Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
597 Encounter in the Medieval World unit, starting with the question: Why was
598 Norman Sicily a site of encounter? Because of its geographical location,
599 multicultural population and tolerant rulers, the Norman kingdom of Sicily was a
600 major site of exchange among Muslims, Jews, Latin Roman Christians, and
601 Greek Byzantine Christians in the twelfth century. At the same time, Latin
602 Christian crusaders were battling with Syrian, Arab, Egyptian, and North African
603 Muslim warriors over territory and religious differences. Whereas in the past
604 historians placed emphasis on religious differences and the Crusades, historians
605 now emphasize the common features of these Mediterranean cultures and the
606 many ways in which Christians, Muslims, and Jews interacted. The Sicily lesson
607 reflects this new world history approach to the medieval Mediterranean. Rather
608 than directly teaching one interpretation, the teacher presents the primary
609 sources, guides students through analyzing them and gathering evidence, and
610 asks students to form their own interpretation to answer the question: Was there
611 more trade (with peace and tolerance) or conflict (especially conflict
612 between religious groups)? Students investigate Al-Idrisi’s world map, excerpts
613 from Geoffrey Malaterra and Ibn Jubayr, documents from the Cairo Geniza and
614 the Venetian archives, lists of trade goods, and visuals of objects created and
615 sold in Sicily through map activities, close readings, a gallery walk, and
616 discussion. Students analyze the content of the lesson in a graphic organizer that
617 also introduces them to the concept of cause-and-effect historical reasoning.
618 The central position of Islamic world in Afroeurasia became increasingly
619 important as trade and exchange expanded. Muslim merchants, scholars and
260Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
620 Sufis traveled between the great cities, such as Córdoba, Damascus and Cairo,
621 which produced luxury goods such as steel swords and embroidered silk capes.
622 Students investigate the question: How did the Muslim empires and
623 institutions help different regions of Afroeurasia become more
624 interconnected? through the second site of encounter in the History Blueprint
625 lesson, Cairo in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Cairo was at the center of
626 the network of roads, sea routes, and cities that supported trade and pilgrimage
627 in the Islamic world, making it one of the most important trade cities in
628 Afroeurasia. Students work with the Sites of Encounter in the Medieval World
629 interactive map either online or through the teacher’s projection to make an
630 interpretation about the question: Looking at its geographic position, what
631 advantages did Cairo have as a trade city? Either individually or in pairs,
632 students read a secondary informative text, “Cairo Background Reading,” answer
633 text-dependent questions, and, in a group, summarize the main ideas of the text
634 in a cause-and-effect graphic organizer around the question: What were the
635 effects of the exchanges at Cairo? The Islamic world was a network of cities
636 that was tied together by common religion, pilgrimage, trade, and intellectual
637 culture. Islamic institutions, such as the pilgrimage (or hajj), caravans,
638 caravanserais, funduqs, souqs, and madrassas, and favorable policies of city
639 and state governments provided major assistance to merchants and travelers. In
640 a gallery walk of primary-source visuals of and text excerpts about these
641 institutions, students gather and analyze evidence using an evidence analysis
642 chart. The same routes also transmitted technologies and food plants. For
261Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
643 example, paper-making technology reached the Southwestern Asia from China
644 around the eighth century and spread from there to Europe in the following 300
645 years. Food plants, including sugar cane, oranges, melons, eggplants, and
646 spinach, were diffused widely along the exchange routes. Lesson three of the
647 California EEI unit, “Arabic Trade Networks,” helps students analyze the
648 circulation of regional products throughout Afroeurasia. Less positive things also
649 spread along trade routes, such as the bubonic plague. The Black Death of the
650 1300s killed millions in China and caused the population of Europe and the
651 Muslim world to plummet temporarily by about a third. In the Cairo lesson,
652 students read primary sources from Ibn Battuta, Agnolo di Tura, and al-Maqrizi
653 describing the impact of the Black Death of 1348-1350 in Europe and the Muslim
654 world.
655 Using the information from the lesson sources, graphic organizers and
656 evidence analysis charts, students write an argumentative paragraph on the
657 question: Which of the effects of the exchanges at Cairo do you think was
658 the most important? They make a claim, state their reasons, and support the
659 reasons with evidence from the primary sources. The “Effects Paragraph”
660 assignment has sentence starters for the claim and reasons and an evidence
661 analysis chart that helps student paraphrase, analyze, and cite evidence. For
662 English Learners, there are also sentence frames with appropriate academic and
663 disciplinary language to paraphrase, analyze, and cite the two pieces of
664 evidence. After providing feedback to students on their claims, reasons, and use
665 and analysis of evidence, the teacher concludes by telling students that they will
262Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
666 be returning to the Islamic trade and pilgrimage network in future units. Muslim
667 merchants eventually traded from China to the Mediterranean, and Jewish
668 merchants also traded freely in the Muslim world. They established communities
669 across Afroeurasia that were connected by family ties and trade connections.

679 The Gupta monarchs reunified much of the subcontinent in the third century
680 CE, ushering in the Classical Age of India. As they study the question: Under the
681 Gupta Empire, how did the environment, cultural and religious changes,
682 and technological innovations affect the people of India? students learn that
683 the Gupta dynasty (280-550 CE) presided over a rich period of religious, socio-
684 economic, educational, literary, and scientific development, including the base-
685 ten numerical system and the concept of zero. Travel and internal colonization by
686 settlers from northern into southern India helped produce a common Indic culture
687 that unified the people of the subcontinent. Buddhist monasteries and Hindu
688 temples and schools spread. Sanskrit remainedbecame the principal literary language
263Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
689 throughout India, with landmark works being produced by writers poets such as the Hindu master Kalidasa and the Buddhist monk VasubandhuAshvaghosha. Enduring contributions of ancient Indian civilization to other
690 areas of Afroeurasia include the cotton textile industry, the technology of
691 crystalizing sugar, astronomical treatises, the practice of monasticism, the game
692 of chess, and the art, architecture, and performing arts of the Classical Age.
693 Students analyze maps of the extent of the Gupta Empire and visuals of its
694 achievements in science, math, art (including music and dance), architecture, and Sanskrit literature. After the
695 fall of the Gupta Empire, India had many states. The Chola Empire ruled over
696 much of southern India and established maritime commercial trading networks
697 throughout much of the Indian Ocean. The Chola are associated with significant
698 artistic achievement that included the building of monumental Hindu temples and
699 the creation of remarkable sculptures and bronzes.
700
Building on their previous study of Hinduism in 6 th grade, students study the
701 question: How did Hinduism change over time? Hinduism continued to evolve
702 with the Bhakti movement, which emphasized personal expression of devotion to
703 God, who had three aspects: Brahma, the creator, Vishnu, the keeper, and Siva,
704 the destroyer. The Bhakti movement placed emphasis on social and religious
705 equality and a personal expression of devotion to God in the popular, vernacular
706 languages. People of all social groups now developed a closer personal relationshiphad personal access to their own
707 personal deities, whom they could adoreworship with songs, dances, processions, and
708 temple visits. Bhakti grew more popular, thanks to the saints such as Ramanuja, Purandara Dasa, Meera Bai
709 and Ramananda. Even though India was not unified into one state, nor did its
710 people belong to a single religion, the entire area was developing a cultural unity.
264Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
711
Students next examine this question: How did Indian monks, nuns,
712 merchants, travelers, and states spread religious ideas and practices and
713 cultural styles of art and architecture to Central and Southeast Asia? During
714 and after the Gupta Empire, trade connections between India and Southeast Asia
715 facilitated the spread of Hindu and Buddhist ideas to Srivijaya, a large trading
716 empire after 600, Java, and the Khmer Empire. In the Sites of Encounter in the
717 Medieval World Lesson 6: Calicut, the “Indian and Southeast Asian Art” activity
718 has students compare art and architecture from India and Southeast Asia. When
719 students have compiled their evidence, the teacher asks them why they think
720 Southeast Asian rulers would adopt religious ideas and artistic styles from Indian
721 kingdoms. After they share their interpretations, the teacher points out that pre-
722 modern rulers displayed their cultural sophistication, generosity and military accomplishments power through temples (and their associated inscriptions) and that the architectural
723 similarities among the temples are evidence of a shared culture of temple-building (through the Āgama-shāstras) and rulership in the
724 region. In addition to personal religious motives, Southeast Asian kings could
725 build up their prestige and legitimacy by adopting the cultural, religious, and
726 artistic styles of the powerful and prestigious Indian kingdoms and empires.
727
Next students examine the question: How did Buddhism spread and
728 change over time? Buddhist missionaries and travelers carried Buddhism from
729 India to Central Asia and then to China, as well as to Southeast Asia, during this
730 period as well. At the same time, Christian and Muslim missionaries were also
731 spreading their universal religions. As it moved outside of India and became a
732 universal religion, Buddhism changed. In 600 BCE, Buddha was sage, a wise
733 man; but by 300 CE, his followers were worshipping the Buddha as a god.

734 Nirvana changed from “nothingness” or “extinction” to a kind of heaven for
735 believers in the afterlife. Mahayana Buddhists also added the idea that there
736 were bodhisattvas, divine souls who delayed entering nirvana to help others on
737 earth. Either here, or in the China unit, students trace the journey of Xuanzang,
738 who departed from China in 627 CE on pilgrimage to Buddhist holy sites in India.
739 He returned home with 527 boxes of Buddhist texts, which he devoted the rest of
740 his life to translating. The building of monasteries along the Silk Road, at
741 Dunhuang, Yungang and Bamiyan, helped transmit texts, people, and religious
742 ideas through Central to East Asia.
743
After 1000, Turks from Central Asia, who were recent converts to Islam,
744 began to conquer states in northwestern India. Sometimes Turkish Muslim
745 leaders forced Hindus to convert, but at other times rulers practiced religious
746 toleration. The most powerful of these states was the Delhi Sultanate. Islam
747 became firmly established politically in the north as well as in some coastal towns
748 and parts of the Deccan Plateau, although the majority of the population of South
749 Asia remained Hindu. There were continuous close trade relations and
750 intellectual connections between India and the Islamic World. As a concrete
751 example of cultural transmission, students may trace the Gupta advances in
752 astronomy and mathematics (particularly the numeral system which included a
753 place value of ten) to the work of al-Khwarizmi, a Persian mathematician of the
754 ninth century, who applied the base-ten numerical system pioneered in India to
755 the study of algebra, a word derived from the Arabic al-jabr, meaning
756 “restoration.” As trade grew along the sea-routes of the Indian Ocean, India

From 300 to 1300 CE, China had a larger population and economy than any
772 other major region of the world. Students begin their study with the question:
773 How did the Tang and Song dynasties gain and maintain power over people
774 and territories? After a long period of disunity, the Sui (589-618) and Tang
775 dynasties (618-907) reunited China. The Tang rulers rebuilt a government
776 modeled on the Han dynasty. Scholar-officials, trained in Confucianism, advised
777 the emperor and administered the empire. Confucian principles specified that
778 government should operate as a strict hierarchy of authority from the emperor,
267Attachment 1C

779 who enjoyed the “Mandate of Heaven” as long as he ruled justly, down to the
780 local village official. The Tang had an active foreign policy and spread their
781 influence along the Silk Road to the west, as far as the border of the Abbasid
782 Caliphate. The two empires fought a battle in Central Asia in 751, from which the
783 Chinese retreated. The Tang dynasty extended influence and cultural pressure
784 on Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. The Song dynasty took over in 960. The Song
785 supervised strong cultural and economic growth, with magnificent cities and
786 cultural productions. The Visual Sourcebook of Chinese Civilization website has
787 visuals and interactive activities to help students analyze primary sources from
788 the Song and other dynasties. The Song instituted an official examination system
789 for scholar-officials, which gave China a civil service bureaucracy many centuries
790 before any other state. China had the strongest and most centralized government
791 in the world. However, the Song struggled militarily against nomadic tribes from
792 the north. One group of nomads overran the Northern Song region and captured
793 the emperor. Survivors of the Song imperial family maintained the Southern Song
794 Empire from 1126 to 1260, when they fell to the Mongols. Under the pressure
795 from the loss of the north to “barbarians,” the Southern Song emphasized the
796 superiority of Chinese traditions.
797
Despite these military problems, China became Afroeurasia’s major economic
798 powerhouse in this period, due to the medieval economic revolution. Students
799 analyze the question: How did the environmental conditions and
800 technological innovations cause the medieval economic revolution? What
801 were the effects of this revolution? Cause-and-effect graphic organizers help
268Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
802 students analyze the many factors that contributed to the Chinese economic
803 revolution that occurred between the seventh and thirteenth centuries. The
804 factors of population growth, expansion of agriculture, urbanization, spread of
805 manufacturing, and technological innovation were both causes and effects of the
806 economic revolution, as each factor intensified the effects of the others. The
807 economic revolution began with the introduction (from Vietnam) of champa rice, a
808 variety that produces two crops per year. Farmers migrated to the Yangzi River
809 valley to take advantage of the increased yield, and the population grew rapidly.
810 Chinese laborers and merchants extended the empire’s system of canals
811 connecting navigable rivers to about 30,000 miles. The system was financed by
812 state taxes on trade, and led to even more trade. Blast furnaces quadrupled the
813 output of iron and steel in the eleventh century alone. Availability of steel enabled
814 increased production in other industries. Technicians experimented with
815 gunpowder rockets and bombs. Woodblock printing became a standard industry,
816 and printed books circulated widely. The hundreds of inventions of the Tang and
817 Song eras included the magnetic compass, advanced kilns for firing porcelain,
818 and wheels for spinning silk. In California EEI unit, “Genius Across the
819 Centuries,” students research five important Chinese inventions of this period
820 (tea, the manufacture of paper, wood-block printing, the compass, and
821 gunpowder), examine a map of China’s natural regions, identify the sources of
822 raw materials used in each invention, and evaluate the influence of these
823 Chinese inventions on the natural systems of medieval China. The teacher points
824 out the similarity of the agricultural revolution in Medieval Christendom at about
269Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
825 the same time (ca. 1000). In both cases, improvements in farming technology led
826 the way, and growth in trade, inventions, cities, and population resulted. Both
827 cultures benefited from increased Afroeurasian trade as well.
828
Students then investigate this question: Why did Quanzhou become such
829 an important site of encounter? Located on China’s southeast coast,
830 Quanzhou was a primary destination for Arab, Persian, Indian, and Southeast
831 Asian ships carrying merchants eager to buy China’s famed porcelain and silk.
832 Because of its extensive internal economy and technological advances, China
833 exported more than it imported. Although the land route to China was sometimes
834 difficult to travel, shipping to and from the southeast coast meant that China was
835 never isolated from outside world. China was also the largest and most
836 centralized state in the medieval world, and government regulations of merchants
837 and foreigners were more thorough. As one of the official trade cities of the
838 Chinese empire, Quanzhou had large foreign communities. In this lesson,
839 students compare the accounts of Ibn Battuta, Marco Polo, and Zhao Rugua
840 about Quanzhou for their multiple points of view on trade and cultural exchange.
841 They write an essay answering the focus question and citing evidence from the
842 primary sources. Students analyze a concrete example of cross-cultural
843 production in the porcelain vases and flasks made in China for export to the
844 Muslim world and Spain.
Grade 7 Classroom Example: Quanzhou, Site of Encounter
(Integrated ELA/Literacy and World History)
270Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
In Ms. Hutton’s seventh-grade world history class, students are learning about
medieval world history. They do this by touring Sites of Encounter, or places of
exchange, in the medieval world. Quanzhou, located on China’s southeast coast,
and one of the largest and busiest ports in the world, is a centerpiece in Ms.
Hutton’s classroom. Students in Ms. Hutton’s class have learned how Quanzhou
was a prime destination for Arab, Persian, Indian, and Southeast Asian ships
carrying merchants eager to buy China’s famed porcelain and silk. As one of the
official trade cities of the Chinese empire (which was the largest and most
centralized state in the medieval world), Quanzhou had large foreign
communities.
As an important part of learning about Quanzhou as a Site of Encounter,
students in Ms. Hutton’s class participate in a guided discussion about the city’s
laws, customs, and multicultural coexistence. Students practice Common Core
and ELD discussion skills based on excerpts from primary-source documents to
answer this discussion question: How did laws and customs help people from
different cultures live together in Quanzhou?
First, Ms. Hutton divides the class up into groups of three or four. Each
student in the group is asked to read one or two primary sources, write a short
summary of the document, and highlight evidence that helps answer the
discussion question on a graphic organizer. To support students’ interrogation of
their sources, she asks them questions like, “Who benefited from this law or
custom? Did the law or custom make people feel safe and welcome? Did it keep
271Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
people from cheating or causing trouble?”
Ms. Hutton then directs her students to share out what they’ve written with
their group. To support student discussion, Ms. Hutton provides various
discussion starters designed to start the conversation, such as, “My document is
about...,” “This law / custom kept people from cheating by...,” “This law/custom
helped people from different cultures live together because...,” and “The
evidence that supports my idea is....” She also provides starters that can be used
to respond to conversation, such as, “Tell me more about...,” “What evidence do
you have?” “How did you come to that conclusion?”
After all group members have shared, Ms. Hutton’s students collectively try to
formulate an interpretation (or main idea) that answers the discussion question
based on all of the evidence. She offers additional sentence starters to support
this part of the discussion, such as “Document xx does not seem to fit with the
other documents, because ...,” “Document xx seems to support the ideas in
document xxx ...,” “I agree / disagree with what Carmen said, because ...,”
“Does the evidence about your law /custom support the interpretation that ...,”
and “Where is the evidence to support this interpretation?”
After each group has formulated an interpretation, Ms. Hutton debriefs the
students as a whole class using these questions to lead the discussion: what is
your interpretation, what evidence supports this interpretation, and what evidence
contradicts this interpretation? She circulates the room during the conversations
to evaluate, and redirect if necessary, her students’ ability to make an oral
272Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
argument in response to the discussion question. As she listens to their
conversation, Ms. Hutton considers her students’ ability to marshal relevant
evidence in support of their argument, their use of academic language, and their
overall understanding of the specific content in this lesson.

Buddhism spread widely and gained many followers in China during the Tang
847 period and began to alter religious life in neighboring Korea and Japan as well.
848 Students return to the question: How did Buddhism spread and change over
849 time? In China Buddhist ideas intermingled with those of Daoism, a Chinese
850 religion emphasizing private spirituality, and Confucianism, the belief system that
851 stressed moral and ethical behavior. At its height in the ninth century, Buddhism
852 had 50,000 monasteries in China. As Confucian scholar-officials and Daoist
853 priests felt threatened by this “foreign religion,” the Tang emperors reversed their
854 earlier acceptance of Buddhism and began to persecute it. One result of this
273Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
855 persecution is that Buddhism did not become the official religion of China.
856 Instead, Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist beliefs and practices fused together in
857 China to form a syncretic popular religion, emphasizing moral living, daily ritual,
858 and dedication to family and community.
859 Students turn their attention to the question: How did Chinese culture,
860 ideas, and technologies and Buddhism influence Korea and Japan? Under
861 the Tang dynasty, China expanded its trade and cultural influence to Korea,
862 Japan, and Southeast Asia. At sites of encounter, these societies adopted and
863 adapted Chinese ideas and institutions and combined those with their own ideas
864 and institutions to build distinct civilizations. This is the adoption and adaptation
865 form of cultural encounter. In the fourth century, three kingdoms emerged to rule
866 the Korean population, and in 670, one of those kingdoms, Silla, unified the
867 whole peninsula. Silla was closely connected to the Tang dynasty of China.
868 Korean elites used Chinese as a written language, but later devised a phonetic
869 script for the Korean language. In 936, the Koryo kingdom took over rule in
870 Korea, and adopted a civil service exam system copied after that of China.
871 Korean merchants were engaged in trade with Japan and China, and through
872 those networks, to Indian Ocean and Afroeurasian trade networks as well. The
873 Korea Society powerpoint, “Silla Korea and the Silk Road,” has images and
874 archaeological evidence that provide opportunities for students to analyze
875 cultural interaction and trade across Eurasia.
876
877
In a similar manner, Japan was influenced by China and Korea, but adapted
outside institutions and ideas to fit with its own indigenous culture. Before the
274Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
878 sixth century, Japan was an agricultural society ruled by land-holding clan
879 chieftains. Their religion, Shinto, emphasized the influence of the supernatural
880 world and spirits of the ancestors. One clan rose above the others, founded a
881 central state and a dynasty called the Yamato. Those rulers claimed the title of
882 “heavenly sovereign,” or emperor. About 850 CE, the Yamato rulers lost their grip
883 on political affairs, and aristocratic palace families assumed real power. The
884 emperors retained their throne but played mainly a ritual role. The pattern of
885 aristocratic clans warring and succeeding one another as rulers under the
886 sovereignty of a ceremonial but powerless emperor continued into modern times.
887 Between the third and sixth centuries, when China was politically fragmented,
888 many Chinese and Koreans migrated to Japan in search of refuge or opportunity.
889 Those newcomers introduced many innovations, including advanced metallurgy,
890 writing, silk production, textile manufacture, paper-making, and Buddhism.
891 Japanese tradition links the introduction of Buddhism and beginning of Chinese
892 cultural influence with Prince Shokotu (574-622). China’s immense power under
893 the Tang Dynasty stimulated Japanese interest in Chinese and Korean culture.
894 Literary scholars, officials, and Buddhist monks traveled to Japan. In turn,
895 Japanese intellectuals went west to seek knowledge, learn Confucian statecraft,
896 and acquire Buddhist texts, some made in Korea with some of the earliest known
897 wood-block printing technology. The Japanese gradually adapted Buddhism to fit
898 with older Shinto practices. For example, Shinto nature gods became associated
899 with Buddhist spirits and saints. The Zen school of Buddhism spread widely
900 among laboring men and women.
275Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
901 From about 1000 CE, the Japanese aristocratic class creatively combined
902 Chinese and Korean ideas with Japanese ways to form a new civilization with
903 distinctive institutions, literature, and arts. Japanese officials adopted rules of
904 government derived from imperial China but tailored them to their own smaller
905 population and territory. Scholars developed a writing system that used simplified
906 Chinese characters to represent Japanese sounds. Moreover, several
907 aristocratic women wrote literary works in Japanese. Students may read
908 selections from the Tale of Genji, a novel about a courtier’s life written by Lady
909 Murasaki Shikibu sometime between 990 and 1012.
910
Even though China had a great influence on Japan, Japanese government
911 and society developed in its own direction. Students investigate the question:
912 What influence did samurai customs and values have on the government
913 and society of medieval Japan? Japan had an emperor, but the emperor and
914 his court had no real power. Clans continued to control regional areas of Japan.
915 Important clans fought each other for more land, power, and control over the
916 weak central government. In the 1180s, the Miramoto clan dominated Japan.
917 They instituted a military government headed by a “great general,” or shogun.
918 The highest social status in the clan and in society went to the samurai,
919 professional fighters. Most samurai were vassals of clan leaders, or daimyo, in a
920 system that was similar to feudal lordship in Christendom at the same time.
921 Samurai were dedicated to a code of courage, honor, and martial skill. To
922 analyze samurai culture, students read The Tale of the Heike and view
923 woodblock prints. The Asia for Educators website has a short excerpt of this
276Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
924 story of samurai warfare, and there are many woodblock prints on the Web,
925 although most date from later periods. During those centuries, Japan’s
926 agriculture, population, and urbanization continued to expand. Exchanges with
927 China and Korea grew, as merchants traded luxury goods in return for Japanese
928 silver, copper, timber, and steel swords. By 1300, East Asia was an
929 interconnected region dominated economically and culturally by China.

938 To begin their study of civilizations in the Americas, students investigate the
939 question: How did the environment affect the expansion of agriculture,
940 population, cities, and empires in Mesoamerica and the Andean region?
941 One important environmental factor was the separation of the Americas and
942 Afroeurasia after 15,000 BCE. As a result, different ecosystems developed in the
943 Americas than in Afroeurasia. The Americas had no beasts of burden; corn was
944 the major staple rather than rice or wheat. A second environmental factor is the
945 sheer size and variety of habitats in the Americas. The north-south axis of the
946 Americas extends nearly 11,000 miles, from the frigid Arctic rim to the equatorial
277Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
947 rain forests of the Amazon River basin to Tierra Del Fuego at the southern tip of
948 South America. A mountain spine runs nearly the entire length, and divides the
949 Americas longitudinally, separating narrow coastal plains on the Pacific from
950 broad plains on the eastern side that stretch toward the Atlantic. Several great
951 river systems, especially the Mississippi and the Amazon, have been channels of
952 human communication since ancient times. Thousands of different cultures,
953 speaking many different languages and following different customs, lived on the
954 two continents. Their ways of life varied from gathering and hunting to agrarian-
955 urban states. Lesson 2 or 4 of the California EEI unit “Sun Gods and Jaguar
956 Kings” guides students through the landforms and climate zones that formed the
957 environment for the two urbanized regions of the Americas.
958
Agriculture developed independently in Mesoamerica and the Andean
959 highlands after 3000 BCE. Farming and village settlement spread through those
960 regions and by the second millennium BCE, the Olmec civilization appeared in
961 Mesoamerica and the Chávin civilization in the central Andes. Unlike
962 Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, or India, these civilizations did not develop along
963 great rivers. The catalyst for developing the Olmec civilization may have been
964 surplus farming produce, population growth, or increasing trade. Connected by
965 exchange of crops and products from the ocean, the lowlands, the highlands,
966 and the rainforest, the Chávin civilization extended across the high Andes range
967 to the lowlands on either side. After the Olmec and Chavín fell, other civilizations
968 took their place or grew up nearby. The Maya, Aztec, and Inca Empires built on
969 the culture and accomplishments of two thousand years of previous civilizations.
278Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
970
Between about 200 to 900 CE, the Maya region of southern Mexico,
971 Guatemala, and Belize had more than fifty independent city-states. The students
972 focus on this question: Why did the Maya civilization gain power over people
973 and territories? The teacher points out that although the Maya built on a basis
974 of civilizations before them, the Maya city-states built larger and grander
975 buildings, developed advanced writing, mathematics and astronomy, and had a
976 more hierarchical and wealthy society. Two factors that gave the Maya power
977 were rich agriculture and widespread trade. Among the largest cities were Tikal
978 in Guatemala and Calakmul in Mexico. Maya societies produced monumental
979 architecture, astronomic observatories, a pictographic writing system that yielded
980 libraries of thousands of books, and a sophisticated calendar system based on a
981 fifty-two-year cycle. These innovations would have given the Maya society strong
982 cultural power, because many neighboring people would have been impressed.
983 Students may compare mathematical systems that developed in Afroeurasia with
984 Maya mathematics, which utilized positional notation, the concept of zero, and a
985 base-20 numerical system. The monarchs and aristocratic families who ruled
986 these city-states kept order and defended their lands in wars with other city-
987 states. They also performed elaborate religious rituals to conciliate the gods who,
988 Mayans believed, commanded the rain and sun. These rituals included blood-
989 letting by members of the elite and royal families. The elites drew blood from their
990 own bodies to offer to the gods. The Maya also sacrificed enemies captured in
991 battle (instead of killing them on the battlefield). Farmers, artisans, and hunters
992 paid taxes and supplied labor for construction of public temples, palaces, and
279Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
993 ceremonial ball courts. After about 750 CE, warfare intensified among city-states,
994 monumental construction diminished, and cities were gradually abandoned.
995 Deforestation, erosion, and drought may have contributed to their decline.
996 The Aztec Empire emerged in the fifteenth century. Initially, students focus
997 on: Why did the Aztec Empire gain more power over people and territories?
998 The Aztecs, a people who originally migrated from northern Mexico, owed a
999 strong cultural debt to the Maya, Teotihuacán, and the Toltec cities in
1000 Mesoamerica. The Aztecs won their power by warfare. They unified much of
1001 central Mexico by defeating all other powerful cities and states. They created a
1002 state based on ingenious methods of farming, collection of tribute from
1003 conquered peoples, and an extensive network of markets and trade routes.
1004 Next students investigate the question: How did Mesoamerican religion
1005 change over time? The Aztec practiced ritual sacrifice of war captives (instead
1006 of killing them on the battlefield), but to a greater extent than the Maya had. The
1007 Aztecs believed that the god of the sun would stop shining and the universe
1008 would collapse without a constant supply of human hearts and blood. Comparing
1009 Maya and Aztec practices shows students how the Mesoamerican religion
1010 changed over time. Students may analyze visuals from Aztec tribute records, the
1011 Florentine Codex, and other codices made in the early Spanish period. Lesson 5
1012 of the California EEI unit “Sun Gods and Jaguar Kings” has an excellent activity
1013 based on the Aztec tribute records as sources. Ultimately, the resentment of
1014 conquered people made the Aztec Empire unstable.
1015
Students also study the question: Under the Aztecs, why was Tenochtitlán
280Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1016 a site of encounter? This is the first part of their study, as they will return to
1017 “Mexico City” as a site of encounter in the Global Convergence unit. Tenochtitlán
1018 was built on an island in Lake Texcoco, with three causeways linking it to the
1019 mainland. The city was built in circles, with temples and government buildings in
1020 an inner square, houses in the outer circles, and floating garden beds on the lake
1021 around the city. It was one of the largest cities in the world at that time. Its
1022 markets contained vast amounts and variety of goods from all over
1023 Mesoamerica.
1024
Students compare the Aztec empire with the Inca state that arose in Andean
1025 South America, with the question: Why did the Inca Empire gain power over
1026 people and territories? Like the Aztecs, the Incas built on a series of earlier
1027 civilizations, but combined cities and states together into a larger empire than
1028 any before in that region. The Inca rulers built a highly centralized political
1029 system that included methods of food distribution in times of poor harvests. They
1030 also created a network of about 25,000 miles of government-controlled roads that
1031 ran along the Andes spine and served military, administrative, and commercial
1032 purposes. The Incas did rely on military power but they also offered important
1033 social benefits to the population. In contrast to the Aztecs, the Incas did not have
1034 a writing system, but they used Andean quipus, or sets of colored and knotted
1035 strings, to keep complex records. To conclude this unit, students can meet in
1036 groups and prepare graphic organizers comparing power, religion, social
1037 customs, agriculture, intellectual developments, and trade in each culture.

How did Arab/North African and West African perspectives differ on West
African kingdoms?
As of 500 CE, groups of farming and animal-herding peoples lived in West
1048 Africa, a region with four large zones of climate and vegetation running west to
1049 east. Students begin with the question: How did the environment affect the
1050 development and expansion of the Ghana and Mali empires and the trade
1051 networks that connected them to the rest of Afroeurasia? The most northerly
1052 belt is the intensely arid Sahara, home to oasis-dwellers and pastoral nomads.
1053 Just south of the desert is the semiarid Sahel zone, where cattle and camel
1054 herding predominated. Third is the tropical grassland, or savanna, which had
1055 sufficient rainfall to support farmers and their fields of rice, sorghum, and millet.
1056 In the far south is the wet tropical forest. There, settled life depended on
1057 cultivation of root crops and other forest foods. In the Sahel and savanna,
1058 agriculture and herding supported the growth of regional trade. Tracing a great
1059 arc across West Africa, the Niger River provided a natural highway of
1060 communication linking different ecological zones. Farming, trade, and early
1061 development of iron smelting stimulated town building. The city of Jenne-jeno,
282Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1062 built in the early centuries CE, was home to artisans who produced iron tools,
1063 copperware, gold jewelry, and fine painted ceramics.
1064
In addition to local markets, West Africa contained rich deposits of gold. Both
1065 Muslim and Christian rulers and traders in the Mediterranean region craved
1066 African gold, notably for coinage. West African merchants acquired gold from
1067 mines in the Sudan and shipped it to towns in the Sahel, where Arab and Berber
1068 merchants carried the gold north on trans-Saharan camel caravan routes. Some
1069 of this African bullion then flowed into Europe or eastward toward India. Students
1070 use the Sites of Encounter in the Medieval World interactive map to investigate
1071 these environmental factors. Then they read Ibn Battuta’s account of the perilous
1072 crossing of the Sahara in an excerpt from the Mali lesson of the “Sites of
1073 Encounter in the Medieval World” unit. They read the text individually first, then
1074 meet in group to discuss and report on one paragraph of the reading, and finally
1075 read the text again and answer text-dependent questions.
1076 The centralized state of Ghana emerged around the eighth century in the
1077 western part of the Sahel zone. The king of Ghana commanded a large royal
1078 household, a hierarchy of officials, and an army of infantry archers. The Ghana
1079 empire had Muslim officials, though the kings probably did not convert. Ghana
1080 slowly crumbled in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, but around 1240, Mali
1081 emerged to rule over a large part of the western Sudan. Mali’s rulers
1082 accumulated wealth collecting tribute from African farmers and taxing trans-
1083 Saharan trade. The royal court employed staffs of both foreign and native-born
1084 Muslims as administrators, and Arabic became the written language of
283Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1085 government and diplomacy. Most of the kings and their officials professed Islam
1086 and introduced Islamic law, though most of West Africa’s population adhered to
1087 their local religions for several more centuries. In the 1300s Timbuktu, a city near
1088 the Niger River, rose as a regional center of trade and Islamic learning.
1089 The gold trade across the Sahara involved Ghana and Mali in Afroeurasian
1090 trade networks. Students focus on Mali with the question: What made Mali a site
1091 of encounter? What were the effects of the exchanges at Mali? Northbound
1092 caravans also shipped ivory, ostrich feathers, and slaves captured in raids and
1093 wars. Merchants marched these captives, including many women, to the
1094 Mediterranean or Middle East principally to serve in Muslim households. The
1095 southbound trade included salt from Saharan mines, a commodity that
1096 commanded huge demand in West Africa. Other southbound commodities
1097 included copper, horses, and Arabic books. Arabic- and Berber-speaking
1098 merchants from North Africa likely introduced Islam to West Africa in the eighth
1099 century. They established bonds with Sudanic traders, many of whom converted
1100 to the new faith. Even for those Africans who did not convert to Islam, Muslim
1101 culture had a significant impact on West African architecture, education, and
1102 languages. The “Sightseeing in Mali” gallery walk activity guides students
1103 through analyzing artifacts from Mali, such as mosques, statues of mounted
1104 warriors, an astronomy book, and the university at Timbuktu. The artifacts show
1105 that the West Africans adopted Muslim culture but also adapted it to fit their own
1106 culture.

1107
In order to probe more deeply into the history of West African kingdoms,
1108 students analyze this question: How did Arab/North African and West African
1109 perspectives differ on West African kingdoms? The “West African and
1110 Arab/North African Perspectives” activity contains excerpts from Arab/North
1111 African sources by al-Bakri, al-Umari, Ibn Khaldun, and Ibn Battuta, and one
1112 West African source, The Epic of Sundiata. All of the written sources about the
1113 West African kingdoms were written by Arab/North African writers, who thought
1114 that West African culture was more primitive than Arab culture. If the historian
1115 relies on their evidence alone, he or she would think that Islam and the gold trade
1116 were almost the creators of West African states. Students access a West African
1117 perspective in the Epic of Sundiata (Sunjata), a heroic king associated with the
1118 rise of Mali. The epic was passed down by griots in an oral tradition until the mid-
1119 twentieth century, when one version of it was recorded in writing. In the close
1120 reading activity, students learn how to identify perspective as they compare
1121 passages. At the conclusion of this lesson, students work with the Sites of
1122 Encounter in the Medieval World map to analyze the position of Mali in the
1123 Islamic world, and compare that position at the end of a single trade route and
1124 within a single trade circle with Cairo’s position at the center of many trade routes
1125 and three trade circles. A brief discussion on the differences between the cultural
1126 center and the periphery will introduce students to this geographical concept.

How did the Mongol Empire destroy states and increase the
interconnection of Afroeurasia?
1131 • What were the effects of the exchanges at Majorca and Calicut?
1132 • How did increasing interconnection and trade, competition between states
1133 (and their people), and technological innovations lead to voyages of
1134 exploration?
1135
Around the year 1000 in Afroeurasia, technological innovations in agriculture
1136 caused massive increases in productivity, population growth, settlement of new
1137 lands, and a great expansion of manufacturing, trade, and urbanization. The
1138 agricultural revolution between the Tang and Song dynasties made China the
1139 center of industry, as it produced new inventions and luxury products desired
1140 throughout Afroeurasia. Innovations spurred a huge expansion of agriculture in
1141 Europe, cultivation of new lands, expansion of trade, and a rebirth of
1142 manufacturing, trade, urban culture, and education. Networks of commercial,
1143 technological and cultural exchange covered most of Afroeurasia. In the center,
1144 the Muslim world (now divided into many states) and India prospered as
1145 producers of goods such as cotton cloth, spices, and swords, and also as
1146 middlemen along the east-west trade routes. While people rarely traveled from
1147 Spain to China, products, technologies, and ideas did. From 1200 to 1490, those
1148 networks grew stronger, busier, and tighter.
1149
The attacks and domination of the Mongol Empire had a huge negative effect
1150 on states, empires, and many people of Eurasia, but it also greatly extended
1151 trade, travel, and exchange between Afroeurasian societies. The teacher
286Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1152 introduces the question: How did the Mongol Empire destroy states and
1153 increase the interconnection of Afroeurasia? In the late twelfth century,
1154 nomadic warriors from the steppe and deserts north of China, the Mongol tribes
1155 (and other Central Asian nomadic tribes), were united by a charismatic leader,
1156 Chinggis (Genghis) Khan, who lead them to conquests across Eurasia. At its
1157 height, the Mongol Empire was the largest land empire in world history. Mongols
1158 were fierce and highly mobile fighters who terrified the people they conquered,
1159 even though their numbers were small. Students examine maps of the Mongol
1160 conquests and empire, and compare these with the Sites of Encounter in the
1161 Medieval World interactive map, which has physical, religious, political and other
1162 maps of Afroeurasia. After Chinggis Khan’s death, the Mongol Empire split up
1163 into four khanates. Chinggis’ grandson, Hulagu Khan, was ruler of the Il-Khanate.
1164 Since the Muslim states were divided, individually they were no match for the
1165 Mongol warriors. Hulagu conquered Persia, Syria and part of Anatolia and
1166 destroyed the Abbasid Caliphate’s capital of Baghdad. Although some feared
1167 that the Mongols would destroy the Muslim world, the Egyptian Mamluk
1168 Sultanate fought the Mongol army and stopped its advance. Mongols in the
1169 Khanate of the Golden Horde overran Russia and attacked Poland and Eastern
1170 Europe. The Khanate of the Great Khan went to another grandson, Kubilai Khan,
1171 who took over China from the Song dynasty. Kubilai established the Yuan
1172 dynasty and kept many Chinese customs, but replaced Confucian scholar-
1173 officials with foreign administrators. The Mongols conquered states in Southeast
1174 Asia and tried twice to invade Japan in the late thirteenth century, but failed both
287Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1175 times. The domination of the Mongols did not last long; three of the four Mongol
1176 khanates fell by 100 years after the conquest.
1177
Although the Mongols killed many people and destroyed many cities in its
1178 conquest, after the conquest, the Mongols tolerated all religions and protected
1179 and promoted trade across Eurasia. Under their protection, the land trade route
1180 from China to the Mediterranean re-opened and trade boomed. The Mongols
1181 also moved people around throughout their empire, using, for example, Persian
1182 and Arab administrators in China, and facilitating the journey of Marco Polo (and
1183 many other less famous people) from Venice to China. The increase in
1184 interaction also spread Chinese technologies and ideas into the Muslim and
1185 Christian worlds. To understand both the negative and positive effects of the
1186 Mongol conquest and empire, student groups do a gallery walk with visuals of a
1187 Mongol passport, hunting scroll, gold textile, and a Persian tile with Chinese
1188 motifs, and an excerpt from Marco Polo describing the Mongolian postal service.
1189 Students cite evidence from each primary source on a source analysis template
1190 to answer the question: How did the Mongol Empire increase the
1191 interconnection of Afroeurasia?
1192 After the Mongol khanates fell, new states and empires arose. As the Il-
1193 Khanate declined, Turkish kingdoms replaced the Mongols. These Turkish
1194 warriors originally came from Central Asia, and spread into the Muslim world
1195 after their conversion to Islam. Combining dedication to religious ideas with the
1196 mounted warrior tradition of Central Asia, they took over the settled Muslim
1197 lands. In the west, Turkish armies took over most of Anatolia from the Byzantine
288Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1198 Empire (a conquest which set off the Crusades). One of the Turkish leaders,
1199 Osman, created the Ottoman Empire in 1326. He and his successors conquered
1200 all of Anatolia, Greece, and most of the Balkan peninsula in eastern Europe,
1201 before conquering Constantinople in 1453 and bringing the Byzantine Empire to
1202 an end. Other Turkish dynasties took over Persia (the Safavids) and northern
1203 India (the Mughals). In China, the native Ming dynasty removed the Mongols and
1204 returned the administration of China’s government to Confucian scholar-officials.
1205 In the remainder of this unit, students with engage with this question: How
1206 did increasing interconnection and trade, competition between states (and
1207 their people), and technological innovations lead to voyages of
1208 exploration? Most states and empires supported trade as the rulers and elite
1209 groups wanted access to products such as silk from China, Persia, Syria, and
1210 Egypt; spices from India and Southeast Asia; cotton cloth from India and Egypt;
1211 and gold from West Africa. Kings and their officials also realized that trade made
1212 their states strong and increased their tax income. Some used their military
1213 power to take over trade centers that belonged to other states or to dominate
1214 trade routes. As trade connections, imperial expansion, and travel increased in
1215 Afroeurasia, both conflict and cooperation occurred at sites of encounter.
1216 Competition between states for land and resources and between the followers of
1217 different religions made many encounters violent. At the same time, people from
1218 different cultures found ways to cooperate so that they could trade and coexist.
1219
1220
Of the major regions of Afroeurasia, medieval Christendom had one of the
least developed but also one of the fastest growing economies. There were few
289Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1221 European products that people in Asia and Africa wanted to buy, but there was a
1222 large and growing market in Europe for Asian spices, cloth, porcelain, and other
1223 goods. Europe had to export silver and gold to pay for these goods. Most of the
1224 silver ended up in China. Between about 1000 and 1300 CE, the ships and
1225 traders from Venice and Genoa rose to dominate long-distance commerce to
1226 Europe from Cairo and other Muslim trade cities in Southwestern Asia and North
1227 Africa. During the same time period, certain states of Western Christendom,
1228 notably England, France, Castile, and Aragon grew stronger and more
1229 centralized. The kings of Castile, Aragon, and other Christian kingdoms of Iberia
1230 fought against Muslim kingdoms of al-Andalus for both religious and political
1231 reasons. As a case study of Christian, Muslim and Jewish interaction in medieval
1232 Iberia, students analyze the site of encounter, Majorca, with the question: What
1233 were the effects of the exchanges at Majorca? King James I of Aragon
1234 conquered this island off the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula from its
1235 Muslim Almohad rulers in 1229. Students read excerpts from James’s
1236 Autobiography in a guided activity that teaches them how to cite evidence. They
1237 learn that James was motivated in part by Majorca’s position as a trading and
1238 shipping center for the western Mediterranean and the Maghribi ports, which
1239 controlled the gold trade from Mali. Catalan merchants urged James to take over
1240 Majorca because they wanted to gain access to those markets. On the Majorcan
1241 base and elsewhere in Iberia, Catalans, Genoese, Iberian Jews, Iberian Muslims
1242 (Moors), and Portuguese developed maps, such as the Catalan Atlas, ships, and
1243 navigational technology which gave Mediterranean shippers access to the
290Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1244 Atlantic Ocean. Accessing the Catalan Atlas reproductions online, students
1245 closely examine this early map of Afroeurasia to identify its improved features,
1246 such as accurate coastlines and a compass rose. In a gallery walk, they analyze
1247 objects, such as the lateen sail and the astrolabe, adopted from the Islamic
1248 world, and the compass, invented in China, and visuals of medieval ships to
1249 identify the technological improvements. These examples demonstrate the
1250 synthesis of creative energies that a site of encounter often produces. Using this
1251 technology, Catalans and Portuguese began exploring the African coast (looking
1252 for a different route to the gold fields of West Africa). However, increasing
1253 intolerance of the Iberian Christian kingdoms to Jews and Muslims ended that
1254 multicultural society by 1500. In the “Investigative Reporting on Intolerance,”
1255 student groups read excerpts from al-Idrisi, Benjamin of Tudela, Ramon Llull, or
1256 Ferdinand and Isabella. Then the student group designs and acts out an
1257 investigative report (as for TV news or a cell phone I-Report). Each student in the
1258 group plays a role in the report, which can be videotaped, recorded on a cell
1259 phone, or acted out live. All reports are shown to the class, and students record
1260 specific information and evidence on a chart. The teacher concludes by pointing
1261 out that England, France, and other states also expelled Jews in this period.
1262 Tired of the persecution, many European Jews migrated to Poland, where the
1263 government gave them security and rights, Russia, and elsewhere in Eastern
1264 Europe.
1265
1266
Next the students switch to a site of encounter in India, Calicut, a major trade
center of the Indian Ocean trading network. As they explore the question: What
291Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1267 were the effects of the exchanges at Calicut? students learn about both the
1268 fifteenth-century Indian Ocean trade and the advent of the Portuguese in 1498. In
1269 the “What’s so Hot about Spices?” activity, students examine written and visual
1270 primary sources about popular spices, where they were grown, and how they
1271 were used as flavorings, medicines, and perfumes. Using the Sites of Encounter
1272 in the Medieval World map, students study the Indian Ocean monsoon patterns
1273 and tables of medieval sailing seasons to determine the effects on ships,
1274 merchants, and sailors. Ships from many states visited Calicut, including Chinese
1275 junks and the huge fleets led by Admiral Zheng He. Between 1405 and 1433, the
1276 Ming emperor sent out enormous fleets of hundreds of ships on seven major
1277 voyages to trade and collect tribute in the Indian Ocean, advancing as far west
1278 as the Red Sea and East Africa. Although after 1433, the Ming emperors did not
1279 send out any more naval fleets, trade continued. In the “Analyzing Perspectives
1280 on Calicut and Trade” group activity, students read primary sources written by
1281 Arab travelers, Jewish merchants, Persian ambassadors, Chinese officers and
1282 explorers, and Portuguese explorers. Each group member chooses an equal
1283 share of the sources, which he or she reads aloud to the group and then guides a
1284 discussion, as everyone else fills out a source analysis chart. Students use the
1285 evidence to write an essay on the question: What were the effects of the
1286 exchanges at Calicut? The lesson has the writing prompt, instructions for
1287 evidence use, an effects organization chart, an evidence analysis chart, an essay
1288 frame, and a grading rubric. The teacher selects among these resources those
1289 that will support English Learners and struggling writers as appropriate.

1290
To conclude, the teacher returns to central question: How did increasing
1291 interconnection and trade, competition between states (and their people),
1292 and technological innovations lead to voyages of exploration? He or she
1293 asks students to identify examples of each of these causes from Majorca and
1294 Calicut. Comparison of the voyages of Zheng He with those of Columbus and/or
1295 Da Gama makes a good transition to the next unit.

1309 This unit begins with the question: What impact did human expansion in
1310 the voyages of exploration have on the environment, trade networks, and
1311 global interconnection? In the last unit, students investigated the state of
293Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1312 Afroeurasian trade and power before the voyages of exploration and the
1313 technological developments in ships and navigation that enabled the European
1314 voyages. They examined the Chinese voyages of exploration led by Zheng He
1315 and the initial Portuguese voyages around Africa to India and Calicut. Now they
1316 turn to the Spanish and Portuguese voyages across the Atlantic begun by
1317 Columbus. As a result of these voyages, new oceanic routes connected nearly
1318 every inhabited part of the world. The Early Modern Period witnessed greater
1319 global connection and exchange, as European conquests and encounters in the
1320 Americas linked both hemispheres in significant ways.
1321
People, plants, and animals were introduced to places where they had
1322 previously been unknown. This “Columbian Exchange” led to profound changes
1323 in economies, diets, social organization, and, in the Americas, to a massive
1324 devastation of Indian populations because of exposure to new disease
1325 microorganisms originating in Afroeurasia. The Columbian Exchange marks the
1326 important biological exchange of disease, flora, and fauna between both
1327 hemispheres. Students investigate the transfers of American crops such as
1328 maize, potatoes, and manioc to Afroeurasia, as well as addictive substances
1329 such as tobacco and chocolate. From Afroeurasia, the Americas acquired
1330 horses, cows, pigs, and sheep. Introduction of new staple crops helped increase
1331 the population in much of Afroeurasia, and the imported animals and plants
1332 transformed the landscapes of the Americas. The Colombian Exchange also
1333 occurred across the Pacific Ocean: American crops transplanted to China grew
1334 the Chinese economy, while the chili pepper sent to Southeast Asia affected food
294Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1335 preparation, the economy, and culture. The diffusion of Afroeurasian diseases to
1336 the Americas had catastrophic demographic consequences. The mortality of as
1337 much as 90% of Native American population allowed European newcomers to
1338 conquer territories in the Americas. Migration by Europeans and forced migration
1339 of Africans to the Americas led to a radically different population mix and the
1340 emergence of new hybrid populations and cultures. Africans enslaved and forced
1341 to migrate outnumbered Europeans in the Americas until the nineteenth century.
1342 The loss of so many people caused severe economic and demographic
1343 disruption in tropical Africa. The effects of the Columbian Exchange were
1344 profound environmental change and huge human population shifts.
1345
European voyages to the Americas and the Indian Ocean transformed world
1346 trade networks. The Spanish extracted precious metals, gold and especially
1347 silver, and the Portuguese, Dutch, French, and English extracted raw materials,
1348 such as lumber and furs, from their American colonies and shipped them to
1349 Afroeurasia. Europeans set up plantations to grow cash crops that were exported
1350 to Afroeurasia. The result was a massive influx of wealth into Europe. However,
1351 Asia remained the world’s most productive center of agriculture and
1352 manufacturing until near the end of this era. Chinese products were so highly
1353 desired in the European market that a substantial portion of the silver taken from
1354 the New World ended up in China as payment for Chinese products exported to
1355 Europe. European states and merchants also took over the shipping of products
1356 around the world’s oceans and seas, gradually replacing the merchant fleets of
1357 other regions. These European states frequently battled with each other to
295Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1358 dominate shipping routes, trade cities, and lands with desirable resources. The
1359 Portuguese battled Indian, Arab, and Southeast Asian shippers in the Indian
1360 Ocean, but the Portuguese were soon themselves attacked and replaced by the
1361 Dutch, who took over the spice islands of Southeast Asia. French and English
1362 fleets and pirates battled Spanish fleets in the Atlantic and Pacific. Ocean trade
1363 expanded and became more militarized as the Europeans took over shipping.
1364 Students analyze maps to see how the more important voyages of exploration
1365 led to the development of global trading patterns and the location of European
1366 colonies by 1750.
1367
Next students investigate the question: Why did the Europeans use
1368 colonialism to interact with Native Americans and some Southeast Asians?
1369 What were the effects of colonialism on the colonized people? It’s important
1370 for students to recognize that the Europeans did not take over China, India,
1371 Africa, and most of Asia until the nineteenth century. For this entire period,
1372 therefore, the major Afroeurasian centers – China, India, and the Islamic World –
1373 were too strong for Europeans to conquer. In lands where states were not as
1374 strong, Europeans established colonies. European armies used gunpowder
1375 weapons to defeat local resistance. Europeans became the government rulers
1376 and officials and changed the laws. They also took desirable land away from the
1377 native owners and gave it to Europeans. Often the Europeans used the land to
1378 grow tropical commercial crops for sale in Afroeurasia. Sometimes the European
1379 government and army forced the native people to work for the Europeans as
1380 well. Finally, European Christian missionaries spread through the colonies trying
296Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1381 to convert local people to Christianity. Some states, such as Spain and Portugal,
1382 supported these missionaries and helped to force local people to change their
1383 religion; other states, such as the Netherlands, did not pay much attention to
1384 missionary activities. The teacher uses a guided discussion format to address the
1385 question: Why did the Europeans use colonialism to interact with Native
1386 Americans and some Southeast Asians? Students brainstorm possible
1387 motives of Europeans and weigh the relative importance of power, wealth,
1388 competition with other European states, and religion, using a discussion guide
1389 with sentence starters modeling academic language. As a group, students rank
1390 the possible motives and explain their reasons, and each student individually
1391 writes a one-sentence interpretation (argument or claim) answering the question.
1392 The teacher emphasizes that although many states had conquered sites of
1393 encounter in the past, colonialism was a new form of interaction between cultures
1394 that was unequal and exploitative.
1395
In addition to conquering areas where there were divisions among many
1396 states, such as Sumatra, Java, Malaysia, and the Philippines, or where there
1397 were no states, such as the Caribbean islands, Spanish conquerors took over
1398 both the Aztec and Inca empires in the early sixteenth century. Students assess
1399 explanations that historians have given for their defeat at the hands of small
1400 numbers of Europeans. Two key factors aided European military efforts. The first
1401 was the introduction of infectious diseases, such as smallpox and measles,
1402 which were endemic in Africa and Eurasia, but against which American Indian
1403 populations lacked even partial immunities. These diseases began to ravage
297Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1404 societies in both North and South America shortly after the Spanish invasions got
1405 underway. The second factor was Spanish success at allying with local groups,
1406 notably the Tlaxcalans, who wished to free themselves from Aztec rule. In the
1407 California EEI unit “Broken Jade and Tarnished Gold,” students learn that the
1408 Spanish needed the natural resources of the region, with a goal of sustaining
1409 their own economic and political systems in the “Old World.” They explore many
1410 human social factors including greed, religious fervor, and disease that left the
1411 Spanish in control of vast lands in Central and South America, eventually
1412 propelling the empire to expand into the lands to the north, including California.
Grade Seven Classroom Example: The Spanish Conquest of Mexico
To assess the impact of the Spanish conquest, Mr. Brown’s students return to
the question: What were effects of exchanges at Tenochtitlán/Mexico City in
the 16 th through 18 th centuries? The students begin by analyzing images of the
conquest and interactions between Spanish and Aztecs/Mexica, which can be
found in the image exercises in the “Conquest of Mexico” materials at the
American Historical Association’s Teaching and Learning in a Digital Age
website.
After Mr. Brown explains how to analyze perspective or point of view, student
pairs source the images and identify evidence of exchanges, effects of
exchanges, and perspective. As they share their evidence, Mr. Brown guides and
refines their understanding of perspective or point of view. Next they engage in a
close reading of excerpts from accounts of the conquest and its early impact from
298Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
the Letters of Cortés, the True History of Díaz del Castillo, Broken Spears, the
Florentine Codex, and the Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies by De
Las Casas. (Excerpts in English and Spanish from all of these works are readily
available on the web, except for Broken Spears, collection of Aztec writings
about the conquest that was originally written in Nahautl and recently edited and
translated into English.) Sometimes Mr. Brown has all students read every
document; other times he divides the documents between student groups. (The
most effective division would have students read one Spanish account and one
Aztec account that addressed the same event or topic.)
Each student reads the document individually first, and then discusses the
question: What is this reading about? with a partner. In the second reading,
students fill out a sentence deconstruction chart that breaks down the most
crucial sentence or sentences of the text, complete a worksheet that helps them
identify unfamiliar vocabulary in context, and then answer text-dependent
questions. For the third reading, the students mark up and annotate the text,
using cognitive markers (for exchanges, effects of exchanges, loaded words,
evidence of perspective or point of view, questions).
After reading all the documents, students meet in groups, identify the
exchanges and effects of exchanges and cite evidence for each on an effects
analysis graphic organizer. As Mr. Brown displays the graphic organizer of
several groups on the elmo, he or she helps students group together common
exchanges, state their points in academic language, and understand any unclear
299Attachment 1C

points. Students investigate examples of the hybrid nature of Colonial Latin
America and assess the contributions of native peoples to the cultural, economic,
and social practices of the region by 1750. (Two concrete examples of this are
the building of the Mexico City cathedral on the location of the central pyramid,
as well as other changes to the spatial geography of Mexico City, and the Virgin
of Guadalupe. Seventeenth-century Dutch, English, and French conquest and
colonization in the Caribbean and North America are introduced and can be
compared with developments in Latin America.)

1414 Next students investigate the transport of African slaves to the Americas and
1415 the creation of racialized slavery with the question: Was slavery always racial?
1416 The teacher refers back to examples of slavery in the ancient and medieval
1417 world, such as Rome, where slaves belonged to all ethnic groups and were
1418 usually captives in war. In the medieval Mediterranean, Christians and Muslims
1419 enslaved captives who did not belong to their own religions. However, slavery
1420 was not necessarily for life, and the children of slaves were not always slaves
1421 themselves. In the Americas and the trade circuit scholars call the Atlantic World,
1422 European slave-traders imported kidnapped Africans to work on plantations and
300Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1423 mines in response to shortages of Indian labor in the Americas. Since relatively
1424 few Europeans wished to migrate to the Americas to perform grueling labor in
1425 tropical climates, European planters and mine operators turned to western Africa
1426 to acquire large numbers of enslaved men and women and thereby have the
1427 labor for large-scale capitalist enterprises in the Americas. In the Americas,
1428 slavery became racialized and Europeans began to cultivate the idea that
1429 Africans were lesser people who were supposed to be enslaved. Students
1430 analyze visuals of the Middle Passage and maps of the Atlantic World trade
1431 routes and the numbers of slaves who were transported to the Caribbean and
1432 Brazil, which vastly outnumbered those who were transported to the Thirteen
1433 Colonies. Attention to these points will prepare students for studying colonial
1434 economies and slavery in Grade 8. Africans took part in the world economy in
1435 ways that profited rulers and traders but that caused misery for millions. The
1436 forced removal of millions of people also had severe economic and demographic
1437 consequences in tropical Africa.
1438 The final question of this unit is: How did the gunpowder empires
1439 (Ming/Manchu China, Mughal India, Safavid Persia, Ottoman Empire,
1440 Russia, Spain, later France and England) extend their power over people
1441 and territories? Wide-scale use of gunpowder technology – cannon and
1442 firearms – transformed warfare and armies. Since these weapons were so
1443 expensive, only states could afford them. Gunpowder technology revolutionized
1444 warfare and enabled the power of the central state or empire to expand greatly.
1445 With firearms, state armies could dominate internal rivals and decimate larger
301Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1446 armies that had no firearms. As a result, some states built large gunpowder
1447 empires using the power of the new technology. These gunpowder empires,
1448 which included Spain, Russia, Ming China, the Mughal Empire in India, the
1449 Safavids in Persia, and the Ottoman Empire, were able to dominate weaker
1450 polities and expand their territories. In England, France, Japan under the
1451 Tokugawa Shogunate, and many other smaller states, rulers used the power of
1452 their armies to deprive feudal lords of their local power and centralize authority in
1453 their own hands. As a result, states became more centralized and governments
1454 grew stronger. Gunpowder empires and states used their armies to attack other
1455 states as well. For example, in the sixteenth century, Ottoman armies attacked
1456 the Austrian Empire, Hungary, and Poland. French and English armies and
1457 navies fought wars against the Spanish and Austrian Habsburg empires.

This unit investigates religious, cultural, and intellectual changes in the period
from 1500 to 1750. Students see the impact of new information flowing into
302Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1469 Europe from the “discoveries” in the Americas as a more critical factor in
1470 reshaping European thought than the cultural movement of the Renaissance.
1471 While the Reformation was a critically important development in Christianity,
1472 other world religions continued to change and spread in this period as well. To
1473 reflect this new historiography, this unit focuses on two strands, religion and
1474 cultural and intellectual developments, both in the world context. Rewriting of this
1475 unit also addresses the problem of teaching abstract concepts to seventh-
1476 graders in May and June. It streamlines the content to focus on the most
1477 important developments and recommends activities that will engage students as
1478 well as challenge them.
1479 To introduce the Reformation, the teacher reminds students that there was
1480 only one Church in Western Europe, headed by the Pope in Rome, but that there
1481 were other Christian churches elsewhere, such as the Orthodox churches. In the
1482 1500s, Roman Christianity split into multiple denominations. Students will focus
1483 on the question: How did the Reformation divide the Christian Church,
1484 millions of people, and European states? By the early sixteenth century,
1485 criticism of the clerical and institutional practices of the Catholic Church (e.g., the
1486 selling of indulgences and corruption by the clergy) was extensive. Martin Luther
1487 not only criticized these practices, but also fundamental doctrines such as the
1488 validity of five of the seven sacraments and the need for clergy and good works
1489 to achieve salvation. He created a new theology that Christian religious practice
1490 be strictly guided by knowledge from within the Bible alone and that salvation
1491 was justified by ‘faith alone.’ Students can analyze Martin Luther’s account of his
303Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1492 tower experience, using the excerpt, sentence deconstruction chart, and analysis
1493 chart on the Blueprint for History blogpost “Martin Luther Primary Source and
1494 CCSS Activity.” A generation later, John Calvin argued for predestination,
1495 whereby those elected by God were certain of salvation. The distinctions
1496 between Lutheranism and Calvinism were significant and led to many separate
1497 denominations within Protestantism. Students examine a diagram showing how
1498 modern Christian churches descended from these original splits in Protestantism.
1499 The Catholic Reformation in response to Protestantism transformed the Roman
1500 Church as well, especially in its practices. All churches stressed education,
1501 understanding of doctrine, and social discipline for lay people.
1502 The Reformation had dramatic effects on European people. All of the new
1503 denominations, Catholic and Protestant, were intolerant of each other and would
1504 not allow believers from another denomination to coexist with their believers.
1505 Mobs of ordinary people sometimes fought over religious differences. The rulers
1506 of states chose one denomination and required all the people living in the state to
1507 belong to that denomination. For example, if Calvinists found themselves living in
1508 a Lutheran state, they had either to hide their belief or move to another country.
1509 The threat of Protestantism added more fuel to the already growing religious
1510 persecution in Spain, which had expelled the Jews in 1492. Spain expelled all
1511 Muslims between 1500 and 1614 and persecuted converts and dissenters in the
1512 Spanish Inquisition. Spanish identity became associated with Roman Catholic
1513 belief and a strong sense of the Spanish mission to protect and spread it, which
1514 showed also in the strenuous and successful efforts of the Spanish to convert the
304Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1515 local people in their Latin American colonies and the Philippines. Protestant
1516 states were also intolerant and executed Catholics and members of other
1517 Protestant denominations. In addition, state authorities executed 50,000 people,
1518 3⁄4 of them women, as witches who had sworn loyalty to the devil.
1519
Whereas the Catholic Church insisted that priests and nuns remain celibate
1520 (unmarried), the new Protestant churches permitted their clergy to marry. In a
1521 few radical Protestant sects, women sometimes became leaders in church
1522 organization and propagation. However, male clergy, both Catholic and
1523 Protestant, generally agreed that even though men and women are equal in the
1524 sight of God women should bow to the will of their fathers and husbands in
1525 religious and intellectual matters.
1526 Religious differences shaped European divisions for the rest of the early
1527 modern era. Most of northwestern Europe, such as England, the Netherlands,
1528 the northern German lands, and Scandinavia, became Protestant, while most of
1529 southwestern Europe, such as France, Spain, the southern German lands, and
1530 Italy, remained loyal to Rome. Religious differences led to wars between Spain
1531 and England, the revolt of the Netherlands, the Huguenot civil wars in France,
1532 and the Thirty Years War in Germany, which ended in 1648. By that time, after
1533 150 years of religious warfare, many Europeans were calling for religious
1534 toleration to bring an end to religious violence.
1535
Students now turn to the question: How did world religions change and
1536 spread during the early modern period? The expansion of global
1537 communications facilitated the further expansion of major world religions, notably
305Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1538 Christianity in the Americas and Southeast Asia, Islam around the Indian Ocean
1539 rim, and Theravada Buddhism from Sri Lanka to Southeast Asia. The Christian
1540 reformation played a significant role in motivating colonization of the Americas.
1541 European missionaries, especially Catholic missionary orders, spread reformed
1542 Christianity in Africa and Asia during the early modern period.
1543 A new world religion, Sikhism, was founded in 1469 in South Asia. Sikhism
1544 was founded by Guru Nanak, a social reformer who challenged the authority of
1545 the Brahmins and the Hindu caste order. Students learn about the Sikh Scripture
1546 (Guru Granth Sahib), articles of faith, the turban, and Sikh history. Guru Nanak
1547 taught that all human beings are equal and can realize the divine within them
1548 without any human intermediaries or priests. Sikhs believe that each individual
1549 can realize the divine on his or her own through devotion to God, truthful living,
1550 and service to humanity. The three basic principles of Sikhism are honest living,
1551 sharing with the needy, and praying to one God. With the addition of Sikhism,
1552 there were now three major religions in India. While relations between people of
1553 different religions were often peaceful, some Mughul rulers, who were Muslims,
1554 persecuted Sikhs. Other Mughal rulers, most notably Akbar, encouraged and
1555 accelerated the blending of Hindu and Islamic beliefs as well as architectural and
1556 artistic forms.
1557
Religious enthusiasm and challenge to orthodoxy in the early modern period
1558 was not unique to Europe. In China the philosopher Wang Yangming (1472-
1559 1529) initiated a reform of neo-Confucian teaching and practice, which he found
1560 dogmatic and snobbish. He argued that ordinary women and men have the
306Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1561 capacity to lead honest lives and know good from evil without learning Confucian
1562 texts and performing ceremonies. In Iran, the Safavid Dynasty gave support to
1563 the Shi’a branch of Islam, thereby challenging Sunni authority. For another
1564 example of adoption and adaptation, students can analyze art and texts from
1565 Java to see how the journey of nine Sufi saints led to a synthesis of local
1566 animism, Hinduism and Islam. On a global scale, religious change in the early
1567 modern period tended to promote more personal forms of practice at the
1568 expense of the power of entrenched religious institutions and clerics. Religions
1569 continued to spread as people sought ways to understand the changes
1570 happening around them.
1571 The teacher makes the transition to the question: What were the effects of
1572 the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution? by telling students that they
1573 will be studying the development and spread of other sets of ideas besides
1574 religious ones. The Renaissance was a cultural and intellectual movement that
1575 began in the Italian city-states in the mid-fourteenth century and spread across
1576 Europe by the sixteenth century.
1577 The Italian Peninsula witnessed significant urbanization and the formation of
1578 prosperous independent city-states such as Venice, Genoa, Florence and Milan.
1579 With wealth generated from trade and industry, and inspired by commercial and
1580 political rivalry with one another, these city-states experienced a remarkable
1581 burst of creativity that produced the artistic and literary advances of the
1582 Renaissance. Through extensive contact with Byzantine and Islamic scholars, a
1583 considerable body of Greco-Roman knowledge was rediscovered. This revival of
307Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1584 classical learning was named humanism. Humanists studied history, moral
1585 philosophy, poetry, rhetoric, and grammar, subjects they thought should be the
1586 key elements of an enlightened education. Humanism facilitated considerable
1587 achievements in literature, such as the works of Dante Alighieri, Machiavelli, and
1588 William Shakespeare, and the arts, such the painting and sculpture of Leonardo
1589 da Vinci and Michelangelo di Buonarroti Simoni. Students investigate the
1590 Renaissance artistic techniques, such as perspective and realistic portraits, and
1591 architectural masterpieces, such as the Sistine Chapel. After 1455, the printing
1592 press, using moveable metal type, and the availability of manufactured paper
1593 disseminated humanism and Italian Renaissance learning to other parts of
1594 Europe and beyond. In Northern Europe, humanist interest in the origin and
1595 development of languages inspired the creation of new and more exacting Greek
1596 and Latin versions of the New Testament as well as vernacular translations of the
1597 Bible. This emphasis on exact reading of the Christian scriptures was an
1598 important influence upon early Protestant thinkers.
1599
Humanism played a continuing role in advancing science, mathematics, and
1600 engineering techniques, as well as the understanding of human anatomy and
1601 astronomy. Discoveries led to a Scientific Revolution in early modern Europe.
1602 The long-term origins of the Scientific Revolution were rooted in the historical
1603 connections with Greco-Roman rationalism; Jewish, Christian, and Muslim
1604 science; and Renaissance humanism. European exploration and colonization in
1605 this period also stimulated a desire for intellectual understanding of the human
1606 and natural world. New information, new plants, and new animals from the
308Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1607 Americas, which were not mentioned in the Bible nor by Aristotle and other
1608 ancient Greek authorities, led many to challenge traditional Christian and
1609 classical ideas about the universe. Scientists replaced reliance on classical
1610 authorities with the methodologies of the Scientific Revolution: empiricism,
1611 scientific observation, mathematical proof, and experimental science. They
1612 created what is today known as the scientific method. A number of significant
1613 inventions and instruments in over the 16 th and 17 th centuries—the telescope,
1614 microscope, thermometer, and barometer— furthered scientific knowledge and
1615 understanding. There were significant scientific theories in astronomy and
1616 physics, including those associated with Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler,
1617 Sir Isaac Newton, and Galileo Galilei (a physicist and astronomer who was
1618 charged with heresy by the Catholic Church for his public support of Copernicus’
1619 theory that the earth revolved around the sun; he spent his final days under
1620 house arrest).
1621
By the eighteenth century, scientific thinking and rational thought in Europe
1622 were reconciled with religious ideas and practice, as scientists justified their
1623 studies as identifying the patterns of the natural world to discover the plan of the
1624 divine. Many people accepted the concept that the universe operates according
1625 to natural laws, which human reason can discover and explain. The development
1626 of a culture of scientific inquiry in Europe was associated with its autonomous
1627 universities in some countries. In these institutions scholars received some legal
1628 protection and were relatively free to study and argue what they pleased.
1629 Gradually, European scientific knowledge began to inform military, agricultural,
309Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1630 and metallurgical technologies. By the early eighteenth century, this culture of
1631 scientific inquiry was diffused beyond Europe through the establishment of
1632 universities in Mexico, Peru, and North America. The teacher sets up a gallery
1633 walk of major inventions and discoveries of the Scientific Revolution and gives
1634 students a source analysis chart that includes the questions: What were the
1635 effects of the Scientific Revolution? What modern ideas or technologies
1636 came from this invention or discovery? When students have completed
1637 gallery walk, the teacher leads a discussion of the effects of the Scientific
1638 Revolution, and lists effects on the board as students identify them.
1639
Newton’s recognition that nature was understandable, predictable, and bound
1640 by natural laws proved an important inspiration to Locke and other early thinkers
1641 associated with the Enlightenment who argued that such laws and
1642 understandings were applicable to the human and moral world as well. The
1643 Enlightenment emerged from the Scientific Revolution, and the political and
1644 social conditions of the 18 th century. The students focus on the question: Why
1645 were the social contract and other ideas of the Enlightenment
1646 revolutionary? Beginning in the late seventeenth century, philosophers began to
1647 employ the use of reason and scientific methods to scrutinize previously
1648 accepted political and social doctrines. Enlightenment thinkers, such as John
1649 Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Charles-Louis Montesquieu, and Thomas
1650 Jefferson, proposed religious toleration, equal rights of all before the law, and the
1651 Social Contract. The teacher focuses on the social contract, as it provides the
1652 necessary bridge to Grade 8. After explaining its three fundamental concepts, the
310Attachment 1C
History–Social Science SMC
October 8–9, 2015
1653 teacher assigns a choice project: students can either write a story, draw a visual,
1654 or act out the three ideas of the social contract. Students work alone on stories or
1655 visuals, but form small groups for the acting option. The students can also
1656 engage in a service learning project that emphasizes the importance of the
1657 responsibility of citizens in a democracy. If the people are the basis of the state,
1658 then they must act to protect the state and other citizens, participate in state
1659 institutions, such as jury duty and voting, and help insure rights for all.
