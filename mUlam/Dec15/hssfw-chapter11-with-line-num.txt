2 Grade Seven – World History and Geography: Medieval and
3 Early Modern Times
4 • How did the distant regions of the world become more interconnected
5 through medieval and early modern times?
6 • What were the multiple ways people of different cultures interacted at sites
7 of encounter? What were the effects of their interactions?
8 • How did the environment and technological innovations affect the
9 expansion of agriculture, cities, and human population? What impact did
10 human expansion have on the environment?
11 • Why did many states and empires gain more power over people and
12 territories over the course of medieval and early modern times?
13 • How did major religions (Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and
14 Sikhism) and cultural systems (Confucianism, the Scientific Revolution,
15 and the Enlightenment) develop and change over time? How did they
16 spread to multiple cultures?
17 The medieval and early modern periods provide students with opportunities to
18 study the rise and fall of empires, the diffusion of religions and languages, and
19 significant movements of people, ideas, and products. Over this period, the
20 regions of the world became more and more interconnected. Although societies
21 were quite distinct from each other, there were more exchanges of people,

234
22 products, and ideas in every century. For this reason, world history in this period
23 can be a bewildering catalog of names, places, and events that impacted
24 individual societies, while the larger patterns that affected the world are lost. To
25 avoid this, the focus must be on questions that get at the larger world
26 geographical, historical, economic, and civic patterns. To answer these
27 questions, students study content-rich examples and case studies, rather than
28 surveying all places, names, and events superficially. Students approach history
29 not only as a body of content (such as events, people, ideas, or historical
30 accounts) to be encountered or mastered, but as an investigative discipline. They
31 analyze evidence from written and visual primary sources, supplemented by
32 secondary sources, to form historical interpretations. Both in writing and
33 speaking, they cite evidence from textual sources to support their arguments.
34 The thematic questions listed above relate to the following major changes that
35 took place during medieval and early modern times:
36 • Long-term growth, despite some temporary dips, in the world’s population,
37 beyond any level reached in ancient times. A great increase in agricultural
38 and city-dwelling populations in the world compared to hunters and
39 gatherers, whose numbers steadily declined.
40 • Technological advances that gave humans power to produce greater
41 amounts of food and manufactured items, allowing global population to
42 keep rising.
43 • An increase in the interconnection and encounters between distant
44 regions of the world. Expansion of long-distance sea-going trade, as well

45 as commercial, technological, and cultural exchanges. By the first
46 millennium BCE, these networks spanned most of Afroeurasia (the huge
47 interconnected landmass that includes Africa, Europe, and Asia). In the
48 Americas, the largest networks were in Mesoamerica and the Andes
49 region of South America. After 1500 CE, a global network of
50 intercommunication emerged.
51 • The rise of more numerous and powerful kingdoms and empires,
52 especially after 1450 CE, when gunpowder weapons became available to
53 rulers.
54 • Increasing human impact on the natural and physical environment,
55 including the diffusion of plants, animals, and microorganisms to parts of
56 the world where they had previously been unknown.
57 One of the great historical projects of the last few decades has been to shift
58 from teaching Western Civilization, a narrative that put Western Europe at the
59 center of world events in this period, to teaching world history. Decentering
60 Europe is a complicated process, because themes, periods, narratives, and
61 terminology of historical study was originally built around Europe. For example,
62 the terms “medieval” and “early modern” were invented to divide European
63 history into eras. Neither of the meanings of “medieval” – “middle” or “backward
64 and primitive” – are useful for periodizing world history, or the histories of China,
65 India, Southeast Asia, or Mesoamerica. Students can analyze the term
66 “medieval” to uncover its Renaissance and Eurocentric biases, as a good
67 introduction to the concept of history as an interpretative discipline in which 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
236
68 historians investigate primary and secondary sources, and make interpretations
69 based on evidence.
70 Themes and large questions offer cohesion to the world history course, but
71 students also need to investigate sources in depth. For this, a useful concept is
72 the site of encounter, a place where people from different cultures meet and
73 exchange products, ideas, and technologies. A site of encounter is a specific
74 place, such as Sicily, Quanzhou, or Tenochtitlán/Mexico City, and students
75 analyze concrete objects, such as a porcelain vase or the image of a saint,
76 exchanged or made at the site. As students investigate the exchanges that took
77 place and the interactions of merchants, bureaucrats, soldiers, and artisans at
78 the site, they learn to consider not only what was happening in one culture but
79 also how cultures influenced each other. They also gain fluency in world
80 geography through maps.
81 Although this framework covers the existing seventh grade content standards,
82 it reorganizes the units. Each of the new units has investigative focus questions
83 to guide instruction and concrete examples and case studies for in-depth
84 analysis. The new units are:
85 1. The World in 300 CE (Interconnections in Afroeurasia and Americas)
86 2. Rome and Christendom, 300 CE to 1200 (Roman Empire, Development
87 and Spread of Christianity, Medieval Europe, Sicily)
88 3. Southwestern Asia, 300 to 1200; World of Islam (Persia, Umayyad &
89 Abbasid Caliphates, Development and Spread of Islam, Sicily, Cairo)

90 4. South Asia, 300 to 1200 (Gupta Empire, Spread of Hinduism and Buddhism,
91 Srivijaya)
92 5. East Asia, 300 to 1300 (China during Tang & Song, spread of Buddhism,
93 Korea & Japan, Quanzhou)
94 6. West Africa, 900-1400 (Ghana, Mali)
95 7. Americas, 300 to 1490 (Maya, Aztec, Inca)

104 The World in 300 CE
105 • How interconnected were the distant regions of the world in 300 CE?
106 This unit serves an introduction to world regions and interconnections as of
107 the year 300 CE. The teacher explains that a central question of the seventh
108 grade world history course is: How did the distant regions of the world
109 become more interconnected through medieval and early modern times? In
110 this unit, they will study the interconnections of world cultures in 300 CE. The
111 world’s people were fundamentally divided into two regions: Afroeurasia or the
112 Eastern Hemisphere, and the Americas, or the Western Hemisphere. In the 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
238
113 Americas, there were many different cultures. In two areas, Mesoamerica and
114 the area along the Andean mountain spine, there were states and empires with
115 large cities supported by advanced agricultural techniques and widespread
116 regional trade. In 300 CE, the Maya were building a powerful culture of city-
117 states, and Teotihuacán in central Mexico was one of the largest cities in the
118 world. These two centers traded with each other. In the Andes region, the state
119 of Tiahuanaco extended its trade networks from modern-day Peru to Chile. While
120 these two regions were probably not in contact with each other, trade routes
121 crossed much of North and South America.
122 Within Afroeurasia, there were many distinct cultures that spoke their own
123 languages, followed distinct customs, and had little contact with other cultures.
124 However, across the center of Afroeurasia, many cultures were connected by
125 trade routes. These trade routes were across land, such as the Silk Road
126 between Central Asia and China, and across seas, such as the Indian Ocean
127 and the Mediterranean Sea. Luxury goods, such as silk from China or
128 frankincense from the Horn of Africa, traveled from merchant to merchant across
129 Afroeurasia from the Atlantic to Pacific Coasts, but the merchants themselves did
130 not travel that far. A small group of elite people (wealthy, land-owning, ruling,
131 noble, religious leaders) in each of those cultures bought imported luxury
132 products. Besides trade goods, travelers on the trade routes carried ideas and
133 technologies from one culture to other cultures. Missionaries of Buddhism and
134 Christianity spread their religious ideas. In 300 CE, the regions of Afroeurasia
135 were much more connected to each other than ever before. However, they were 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
239
136 not as connected and intertwined as they are today. In 300 CE, the most
137 important influences in each culture came from within that culture, rather than
138 from contacts with the outside world.
139 Although there were hundreds of different cultures in Afroeurasia, there were
140 four empires, states, and cultures that dominated the center of Afroeurasia.
141 These were the Roman Empire (Mediterranean Region and Europe), the
142 Sasanian Persian Empire (Southwestern Asia), Gupta Empire (South Asia), and
143 China (East Asia). Students analyze maps that show these empires across
144 Afroeurasia and trace the trade routes (on land and sea) that connected them.
145 Migrations continued to be important change factors. Along the northern edge
146 of the agricultural regions of China, India, Persia and Rome, in the steppe
147 grasslands, pastoral nomad societies moved east and west. Some formed
148 mounted warrior armies which attacked the empires of China, India, Persia, and
149 Rome and disrupted commerce on the silk roads and land trade routes across
150 Eurasia. In Oceania, Polynesian explorers used outrigger canoes and
151 navigational expertise to expand their settlement to new islands across the
152 Pacific. In Sub-Saharan Africa, Bantu-speaking farmers were expanding
153 southward and founding communities, mixing with or displacing older cattle-
154 herding and foraging populations and expanding town and trade networks.
155 Between 300 and 600 CE, the disruptions caused by the migrations and
156 attacks and the decline of some empires (such as Han China, Parthian Persia,
157 and the Western Roman Empire), made these turbulent times for many peoples
158 of the world. The number of big cities declined from an estimated 75 in 100 CE to 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
240
159 only 47 by 500 CE. But in other areas of the world, the networks of trade and
160 interconnection expanded. As trade across the Sahara increased, Ghana
161 emerged as a new commercial kingdom along the southern edge of the desert.
162 The routes expanded southward to Aksum in East Africa, which flourished as a
163 center of Indian Ocean trade. In the seventh century, a dynamic period of trade
164 and cultural interchange took hold across Afroeurasia. Trade and the spread of
165 religious ideas between societies in Afroeurasia increased again.
166
167 Rome and Christendom, 300 to 1200
168 • How did the environment and technological innovations affect the growth
169 and contraction of the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, and
170 Medieval Christendom? What impact did human expansion have on the
171 environment?
172 • How was Rome a site of encounter?
173 • How did the Roman Empire gain and maintain power over people and
174 territories?
175 • Did the Roman Empire fall?
176 • How did the religion of Christianity develop and change over time? How
177 did Christianity spread through the empire and to other cultures?
178 • How did the decentralized system of feudalism control people but weaken
179 state power?
180 This unit builds on the sixth-grade study of Roman civilization. Even if
181 students did not study the Roman Republic in sixth grade, the seventh-grade 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
241
182 teacher should not spend time reviewing that phase of Roman history. Instead
183 the teacher should begin with the question: How did the environment and
184 technological innovations affect the growth and contraction of the Roman
185 Empire? Rome began on the Italian peninsula and spread around the
186 Mediterranean Sea. At its greatest extent, the empire stretched from Britain to
187 Egypt and from the Atlantic to Iraq. It united the entire Mediterranean region for
188 the first (and only) time. Although the Romans did conquer northwestern Europe,
189 they were more at home in the warm, dry climate around the Mediterranean Sea.
190 Geographically, northern Europe lies within the temperate climatic zone that in
191 ancient and early medieval times was heavily forested. Atlantic westerly winds
192 bring high rainfall, mostly in winter, to ocean-facing Europe. Deeper into Eurasia,
193 however, these latitudes become drier and colder. In Mediterranean Europe,
194 mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers prevail. Beginning in ancient times,
195 farmers converted forests of southern Europe into wheat fields, olive orchards,
196 and vineyards. Farming advanced more slowly in the dense woodlands and
197 marshes of the north. The California EEI Curriculum Unit, “Managing Nature’s
198 Bounty,” has a map of the physical features and natural regions of Europe and
199 lesson 4 explores the products of different European regions. Students analyze
200 what effect geographic location had on the Roman Empire and on the Germanic
201 peoples who lived in the northern forests beyond the Danube and Rhine rivers.
202 Students map the extent of the empire and label the most important provinces
203 (Egypt, Spain, Gaul, Greece, Syria, Palestine) and bodies of water. They also
204 examine Roman buildings and roads to see the application of the two most 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
242
205 important Roman technological innovations: the arch and cement. Studying maps
206 of roads, trade routes, and products traded within the empire shows that the
207 Roman Empire was based on a network of cities. Those cities were dependent
208 on trade with other regions of the empire. This is common today, but in the
209 ancient world, it was not.
210 The teacher does not review the Roman Republic, but begins with the Roman
211 Empire at its height, with the question: How was Rome a site of encounter? A
212 site of encounter is a place where people of different cultures meet and
213 exchange products, ideas, and technologies. At the site of encounter, new
214 products, ideas, and technologies are often created because of the exchange.
215 Rome was a multicultural empire. Romans spoke Latin, but they conquered
216 Egyptians, Greeks, Syrians, Jews, Celts and Gauls, people who spoke Greek,
217 Aramaic, and hundreds of other languages, and followed dozens of religions.
218 Roman emperors built up the city of Rome to bring together the best from their
219 empire and the world. Through studying Rome as a site of encounter, students
220 explore the character and contributions of Roman civilization at its height.
221 Residents benefited from sophisticated art, architecture, and engineering. For
222 example, the Romans constructed huge aqueducts to bring water to cities from
223 many miles away. Imports of grain and olive oil fed the city of between one and
224 two million people at its height. The city featured a Colosseum for gladiatorial
225 contests, a race track, theaters, baths (for both bathing and socializing), and
226 elegant forums with markets and law courts. Many great thinkers and writers,
227 such as the Pliny the Elder, Juvenal, Plutarch, and Virgil (or Vergil), lived and 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
243
228 wrote during the Roman Peace (Pax Romana), the two centuries of prosperity
229 that began with the reign of Augustus Caesar (27 BCE-14 CE). However, this
230 prosperity was based on riches from conquest and slave labor on large
231 agricultural estates that provided food and luxuries for the cities. Wealthy
232 Romans also purchased luxuries, such as silk from China, medicines and jewels
233 from India, and animals from sub-Saharan Africa, brought into the empire by
234 merchants on the Silk Road and other Afroeurasian trade routes.
235 Next students examine the question: How did the Roman Empire gain and
236 maintain power over people and territories? After Augustus, Rome was ruled
237 by an emperor who theoretically had total power. However, in practice, the power
238 of the emperor was limited by the lack of an effective administration, except in
239 the military. The Roman legions were the source of imperial authority. For civilian
240 government, the empire relied on attracting local elites (landowners, wealthy
241 and/or powerful people, religious leaders) to become local administrators.
242 Corruption was a huge problem, and military leaders had too much power.
243 However, the unity of Rome and the power of its culture gave many people a
244 strong reason to support the empire. Roman citizenship was initially given to
245 people from the provinces as a reward for service, for example, to retired
246 auxiliary soldiers. They and their sons then had the right to vote. Gradually,
247 everyone in the provinces gained citizenship, except for slaves. Broadening
248 citizenship was a deliberate policy of certain emperors, who believed it would
249 cause more people to support the empire and help it run smoothly. Roman laws
250 also helped solidify the empire. A body of laws was passed down through the 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
244
251 centuries and ultimately influenced legal systems in modern states such as
252 France, Italy, and Spain, as well as Latin American countries.
Grade Seven Classroom Example: The Roman Empire
To understand the Roman perspective on the empire’s power over other
people and territories, students do a close reading of an excerpt from Vergil’s
Aeneid (Book VI, lines 845-853). Mr. Taylor gives students a copy of the excerpt
with the guiding question: What did the poet Vergil think about the Roman
Empire’s power over people and territories? The handout also has a
sentence deconstruction chart for the excerpt and a source analysis template.
For the first reading, the students read the excerpt to themselves and then
discuss these questions: Did Vergil think Roman power was good or bad for
the conquered people? What words support your answer? For the second
reading, Mr. Taylor guides the students through a sentence deconstruction chart,
pointing out the parallel phrases describing the “others” (the Greeks and
Persians) and “you” (the Romans). The students also complete the source
analysis template, with information from the textbook or teacher notes. They
learn that Vergil was a Roman poet in the first century BCE. His patron was
Augustus Caesar, the founder of the Roman Empire.
The historical context for the writing of the Aeneid was the beginning of the
Roman Empire. In fact, Vergil wrote this poem to glorify the new empire and
Augustus as its leader. For the third reading, Mr. Taylor divides the students up
into pairs. Each pair marks up the text with cognitive markers and annotates it in 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
245
the margins. He then displays several of the pairs’ annotated texts on the elmo,
explains difficult points, and answers questions. For the fourth reading, students
answer text-dependent questions. For the final question, Mr. Taylor calls for an
interpretation to answer the focus question.

254 In the late second century, the Romans came up against limits. Roman
255 armies could not defeat the Persian Empire in the east, and there was little
256 reason to expand into the rural communities and forests of northeastern Europe.
257 Deprived of its income from conquest, Rome still had to defend its frontier on the
258 Rhine and Danube rivers from the Germanic peoples and its border with the
259 Persian Sasanian Empire in the east. In the third century, the emperors
260 Diocletian and Constantine separated the Roman Empire into two halves and
261 reformed the empire to focus its resources on military defense. Constantine
262 established a new capital for the Eastern Roman Empire at Byzantium, which he
263 renamed Constantinople.
264 At this point, the teacher shifts to the development of Christianity. In the early
265 years of the Roman Empire, Christianity began as a sect of Judaism in Palestine,
266 a province of the Roman Empire. The teacher focuses on the question: How did 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
246
267 the religion of Christianity develop and change over time? How did
268 Christianity spread through the empire and to other cultures? According to
269 the New Testament of the Christian Bible, Jesus, a Jewish carpenter from the
270 small Judean city of Nazareth, began to preach a message of peace and divine
271 salvation through love. He taught that God loved all his creation, regardless of
272 status or circumstance, and that humans should reflect that love in relations with
273 one another. Jesus confirmed the Jewish belief in one God, but he added the
274 promise of eternal salvation to believers. The Roman authorities in Judea
275 executed Jesus. But under the leadership of his early followers, notably Paul, a
276 Jewish scholar from Anatolia, Christians took advantage of Roman roads and
277 sea lanes to travel widely, preaching to both Jews and others. As missionaries
278 spread Christianity beyond the Jewish community, they abandoned some Jewish
279 customs, such as dietary laws, to make the new religion more accessible to non-
280 Jews. Christian communities multiplied around the Mediterranean, through
281 Persia, and into Central Asia. The church communities welcomed new converts
282 without consideration of their political or social standing, including the urban poor
283 and women. Upper class and influential Romans who converted appear to have
284 been predominantly women, and some of them assumed leadership positions.
285 Many Jews did not convert to Christianity, and Judaism and Christianity split into
286 two separate religions.
287 The Romans had an official state religion (Jupiter, Juno, deified former
288 emperors) but they allowed people they had conquered to follow other religions.
289 However, after some Jews rebelled against Roman rule, the Romans exiled 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
247
290 many Jews from Palestine, which led to the diaspora, or spreading out, of Jewish
291 communities across Afroeurasia. Christians also got into trouble with Roman
292 authorities because Christians refused to attend the official sacrifices to the
293 Roman gods. The Roman authorities sometimes persecuted Christians and
294 executed them, but at other times, Christians were left alone.
295 In the fourth century CE, Emperor Constantine legalized the religion of
296 Christianity, and soon after, it became Rome’s state religion. Constantine wanted
297 the Christian Church to unify and support the now divided Roman Empire. As it
298 became a state religion, Christianity changed. The bishops who had been
299 leaders of semi-secret, persecuted communities were now charged with
300 supporting the Roman Empire. Constantine insisted that the bishops hold a
301 council at Nicaea and agree on one set of Christian beliefs, summarized in the
302 Nicene Creed. Church leaders selected certain texts (gospels and letters) for the
303 official Christian Bible, which was translated into Latin. They organized the
304 Christian Church with a Roman structure and gave their support to Roman
305 authorities. Church leaders then vigorously tried to convert everyone to
306 Christianity. As the Western Roman Empire shrank, Christian bishops often took
307 over administration and defense of Roman cities.
308 The teacher points out that all religions change over time. In the historical
309 context of 203 CE, when Christians were sometimes persecuted by the Romans,
310 martyrs were very admired and made into saints of the early church. When
311 Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, the religion
312 changed again, and the new emphasis was on obeying Roman authorities, 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
248
313 behaving well, and converting non-believers to Christianity. The teacher
314 concludes by telling students that they will return to this question about the
315 development and changes in Christianity later in the unit.
316 Teachers now introduce students to the question: Did the Roman Empire
317 fall? In 476 CE, the empire in the west disappeared, though the eastern half
318 continued to thrive. As the Byzantine Empire, this Greek-speaking Roman state
319 survived until 1453. Students examine the evidence (from the textbook or teacher
320 notes) and form their own interpretations to answer the lesson question. They
321 examine factors that might have contributed to the collapse of western Rome:
322 declining financial resources, political corruption and insubordinate military
323 groups, excessive reliance on slave labor, depopulation from epidemics, and
324 worsening frontier assaults, as the Huns migrated westward and pushed waves
325 of Germanic tribes into the empire. By the time the Western Roman Empire
326 ended in 476 CE, it had already shrunk into a small area, a shadow of its former
327 extent. The teacher may point out that mounted warrior armies from Central
328 Eurasia caused problems for China, India, and Persia as well, and contributed to
329 a decline of trade on the silk roads and other land routes across Eurasia between
330 300 and 600 CE. The teacher has students meet together in groups to discuss
331 the question and use their notes to make a T-chart of the reasons and evidence
332 that support the “fall” of Rome, and the reasons and evidence that contradict the
333 “fall” of Rome. Then the groups evaluate the reasons and evidence and
334 formulate a one-sentence interpretation answering the question: Did the Roman
335 Empire fall? The teacher also explains that if they argue that Rome did not fall, 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
249
336 they should choose another word to characterize the end of the Western Roman
337 Empire and the transition to the Byzantine Empire in the east. After student
338 groups prepare their T-charts and write their interpretations, a student volunteer
339 from each group writes the group’s interpretation on the board. Groups share
340 their reasons and evidence for and against, as the teacher records it on a T-chart
341 on the board. Then the teacher and students review and discuss each of the
342 interpretations. The teacher instructs student groups to review and revise their
343 interpretations if necessary and identify the two pieces of evidence that best
344 support their interpretation. The teacher explains that evidence must be specific.
345 After students have selected the evidence in groups, each student writes a
346 paragraph answering the question: Did the Roman Empire fall? They must
347 include the two pieces of evidence. To support English Learners, the teacher
348 provides a paragraph frame that starts each sentence with appropriate academic
349 historical language.
350 Next students study the Byzantine Empire, with the question: How did the
351 environment and contact with other cultures affect the growth and
352 contraction of the Byzantine Empire? The Eastern Roman Empire was
353 stronger than the Western portion. It had more people, more cities, greater
354 manufacturing and commerce, more tax revenues, and more effective defenses
355 against mounted warrior attacks from the north. Its military strength and wealth
356 from the Afroeurasian luxury trade caused a flowering culture in the period
357 between 600 and 1000 CE. The Byzantine Empire, as the eastern lands became
358 known, had strong historical connections to earlier Hellenistic civilization. Its 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
250
359 language was Greek, not Latin. This state was highly centralized around its
360 capital of Constantinople and the rule of the emperor and his officials. The
361 Christian church in the Byzantine Empire was closely connected to the emperor
362 and his administration.
363 The Byzantine Empire continued the Roman Empire’s conflicts with the
364 Persians along the eastern frontier. This long conflict weakened both empires
365 and left them vulnerable when Muslim armies attacked in the mid-seventh
366 century. While Muslim Arabs conquered the Sasanid Empire, the Byzantine
367 Empire survived, but lost huge territories in North Africa and western Asia. The
368 Byzantine Empire shrank but it did not fall until 1453.
369 In the fourth and fifth centuries, the Western Roman Empire fragmented,
370 causing population to fall, cities to shrink, and agriculture to contract. As the
371 empire shrank, Germanic armies and migrants overran Europe, dividing the
372 region into small rudimentary kingdoms. The teacher begins to prepare students
373 for the question: How did the decentralized system of feudalism control
374 people but weaken state power? The teacher points out that early medieval
375 kingdoms did not have strong authority. Local leaders and landholders were
376 much more effective rulers of their small territories. In the Middle Ages, all power
377 was local, not centralized in a state. Over the next few centuries, there was little
378 trade, and most cities disappeared. In the eighth century, a Muslim dynasty
379 founded a strong state in Iberia. Charlemagne (768-814), was an exceptionally
380 strong Christian king, who temporarily united a large part of Europe in the late
381 eighth century and contributed much to the advancement of Latin literacy,

251
382 learning, and the arts. Students may read excerpts from Einhard’s Life of
383 Charlemagne to analyze the factors that made Charlemagne’s rule so
384 successful.
385 After Charlemagne, political order was again fragmented by Viking, Magyar,
386 and Muslim invasions. Local power, established in parts of Western Christendom
387 through feudal relations, was the key to defeating the invaders. In feudalism,
388 kings and powerful regional rulers offered protection and farm estates, or
389 manors, to less powerful knights in return for loyalty and military service. The
390 manors provided the income needed for a knight’s horses, armor, and training.
391 Knights, as lords of the manors, also controlled the serfs, peasants who were tied
392 permanently to manor and obligated to give their lord labor and crops in return for
393 security. Knights, regional lords, and aristocrats gained rights to hand down fiefs
394 to heirs. Mothers and prospective wives often exerted great influence over
395 marriages and family alliances. Gradually the elite mounted warriors began to be
396 known as nobles.
397 These nobles wanted to keep control over local areas rather than to give
398 power to the king and central government. Students learn about the conflict
399 between King John and the great nobles in England, who forced the king to grant
400 the Magna Carta. This document guaranteed trial by jury of one’s peers and the
401 concept of no taxation without representation. From this root, other medieval
402 developments in England, such as common law and Parliament, gradually limited
403 the king’s power and laid the foundations of English constitutional monarchy.

252
404 In addition to considering the political aspects of feudalism, students look at
405 these questions: How did the environment and technological innovations
406 affect the growth of Medieval Christendom? What impact did human
407 expansion have on the environment? In the tenth century, serfs and free
408 peasants employed new technologies, such as the moldboard plow and the
409 horse collar, to cultivate new farmland and boost agricultural production. Around
410 1000 CE, these innovations caused an agricultural revolution in Western
411 Christendom, which caused the population to increase, trade to expand, and
412 cities to grow again. In this expansion, many of the forests of northern Europe
413 were cut down, as humans used wood for heating and cooking and cleared land
414 for farming. Lessons 2 and 3 of the California EEI Curriculum Unit, “Managing
415 Nature’s Bounty: Feudalism in Medieval Europe,” analyze how feudal relations
416 and the manor system allocated ecosystem resources, and how physical
417 geography influenced feudal administrative positions and resource management.
418 As students return to study of Christianity, they return to the question: How
419 did the religion of Christianity develop and change over time? First, they
420 trace on a map the spread of Christianity across Europe and Afroeurasia (as far
421 east as Central Asia). In the Middle Ages, people called the Christian parts of
422 Europe “Christendom,” which shows that an important part of their identity was
423 being Christian. Since kings and states were so weak, the Church, whose
424 hierarchy of clerics extended from the Pope down to the village priest, became
425 the largest, most integrated organization in Europe. The Church followed a
426 hierarchy adopted from the Roman Empire. Missionaries spread out to convert 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
253
427 Germanic and Slavic people to Christianity. Christianity spread in Central and
428 Eastern Europe, facilitating formation of states such as Poland in 966. Although
429 most of the conversions were voluntary, some Christian kings forced people to
430 convert to Christianity, as Charlemagne did to the Saxons in early 800s. Wealthy
431 Christians donated land to monasteries, filled with monks and nuns who pledged
432 themselves to live separately from the world. These monks and nuns were the
433 only educated people, and they devoted themselves to copying Roman and
434 Christian texts. Around 900, popes began to assert their control over the church
435 hierarchy, which brought them into conflict with secular monarchs. Students learn
436 about the split between the Orthodox Church, which acknowledged the
437 leadership of the patriarch of Constantinople, and the Catholic Church, which
438 recognized the authority of the pope in Rome. Churches in Eastern Europe
439 (Russian, Greek, Serbian) followed the Orthodox or Greek Church, since
440 missionaries led by Constantinople had converted their people to Christianity.
441 Because missionaries led by Rome had converted people in Western, Central
442 and Northern Europe, these remained in “the Church,” also called the Latin
443 Church and, later, the Roman Catholic Church.

445 Southwestern Asia, 300-1200: Persia and the World of Islam
446 • How did the environment affect the development and expansion of the
447 Persian Empire, Muslim empires, and cities? What impact did this
448 expansion have on the environment?

449 • How did Islam develop and change over time? How did Islam spread to
450 multiple cultures?
451 • What were the multiple ways people of different cultures interacted at the
452 sites of encounter, such as Baghdad?
453 • Why was Norman Sicily a site of encounter?
454 • What were the effects of the exchanges at Cairo?
455 • How did the Muslim empires and institutions help different regions of
456 Afroeurasia become more interconnected?
457 This unit examines the geography of Southwestern Asia (including the Middle
458 East), the Persian Sasanian Empire, the emergence and development of Islam,
459 the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, and the spread of Islam, and interactions
460 at three sites of encounter, Baghdad in the eighth century, Sicily in the twelfth
461 century, and Cairo in the fourteenth century. The teacher begins with introducing
462 the question: How did the environment affect the development and
463 expansion of the Persian Empire, Muslim empires, and cities? What impact
464 did this expansion have on the environment? A climatic map of Southwestern
465 Asia shows that much of this area falls within a long belt of dry country that
466 extends from the Sahara Desert to the arid lands of northern China. In lesson
467 one of the California EEI Curriculum Unit, “Arabic Trade Networks,” students
468 examine the physical features and natural systems of the Arabian Peninsula and
469 the human improvements to farming practices which increased supplies of food.
470 Across this dry zone, including Arabia, pastoral nomads herded camels and other
471 animals, and oasis cities sheltered farmers, artisans, and merchants. North of the 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft

255
472 Arabian peninsula is the lush agricultural land of Mesopotamia and Persia. Here
473 settled farmers had supported an advanced civilization going back to ancient
474 Mesopotamia. A map of the eastern hemisphere also shows students that
475 Southwestern Asia, Persia, Arabia, the Red Sea, and the Persian (Arabian) Gulf
476 were natural channels for land and sea trade in spices, textiles, and many other
477 goods between the Indian Ocean world and the Mediterranean area. These
478 geographical factors put Southwestern Asia and Arab, Persian, and Indian
479 merchants and sailors at the center of the Afroeurasian trade networks, which
480 began to grow dynamically after the seventh century.
481 The teacher turns briefly to the Persian Sasanian Empire from 300 to 651,
482 when it was conquered by Muslim armies. The teacher reminds students that the
483 Persian Empire (under different names, which aren’t important for the students to
484 memorize) had existed from about 550 BCE and was the heir to the ancient
485 civilization of Mesopotamia. It was the most important state in Southwestern Asia
486 and Rome and the Byzantine Empire’s great rival for power in the eastern
487 Mediterranean and western Asia. In the sixth century, the Sasanians ruled an
488 empire that began at the Euphrates River and covered modern Iraq, Iran,
489 Afghanistan, and parts of central Asia. Their ruler was called by the title “King of
490 Kings.” The official religion of Persia was Zoroastrianism, but they practiced
491 religious toleration. Many Jews and Christians lived in the Persian Empire. Every
492 land trade route across central Eurasia passed through the Persian Empire, and
493 the tax income from the trade made the Persians wealthy. Continued warfare

256
494 against the Byzantine Empire weakened the Sasanian Persian Empire in the
495 mid-seventh century and contributed to its fall to Muslim armies.
496 The students now turn to the emergence of the religion of Islam, as they study
497 the question: How did Islam develop and change over time? How did Islam
498 spread to multiple cultures? Along with Judaism and Christianity, Islam is an
499 “Abrahamic” religion, that is, a faith built on the ancient monotheism of Abraham.
500 Beginning in 610, Muhammad (570-632 CE), a resident of the small Arabian city
501 of Mecca, preached a new vision of monotheistic faith. According to Muslim
502 tradition, Muhammad, an Arabic-speaking merchant, received revelations from
503 God, which were written down in the Qur’an. This message declared that human
504 beings must worship and live by the teachings of the one God and treat one
505 another with equality and justice. Divine salvation will come to the righteous, but
506 those who deny God, “Allah” in Arabic, will suffer damnation. God’s
507 commandments require all men and women to live virtuously by submitting to
508 Allah and following the Five Pillars. Like Christianity and unlike Judaism, there is
509 an afterlife in Islam; faithful believers are promised paradise after death. Islamic
510 teachings are set forth principally in the Qur’an and the Hadith, the sayings and
511 actions of Muhammad. These were the foundation for the Shariah, the religious
512 laws governing moral, social, and economic life. Islamic law, for example,
513 rejected the older Arabian view of women as “family property,” declaring that all
514 women and men are entitled to respect and moral self-governance, even though
515 Muslim society, like all agrarian societies of that era, remained patriarchal, that is,
516 dominated politically, socially, and culturally by men. 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
257
517 Muhammad also founded a political state in order to defend the young Muslim
518 community. He led armies of desert tribes to take over all of the Arabian
519 peninsula. After his death, the leaders of the Muslim community chose one of his
520 followers to be their new leader, with the title “caliph.” The caliphs sent armies
521 northward to conquer part of the Christian Byzantine Empire and all of the
522 Persian Sasanian Empire. As the Muslim conquests multiplied, the Umayyad
523 dynasty of caliphs ruled an empire called the Umayyad Caliphate. Muslim armies
524 continued to conquer land until by 750 CE, the Umayyad Caliphate extended
525 from Spain to northern India. Muslims did not force Christians or Jews, “people of
526 the book,” to convert, but people of other religions were sometimes forced to
527 convert. Non-Muslims had to pay a special tax to the caliphate. Gradually more
528 and more people in the caliphate converted to Islam, and Arabic, the language of
529 both the conquerors and the Qur’an, achieved gradual dominance across much
530 of Southwestern Asia (except in Persia) and North Africa. The Umayyad
531 caliphate broke into several states after 750, but most of the Middle East
532 remained unified under the caliphs of the Abbasid dynasty (751-1258) with its
533 capital in Baghdad.
534 The teacher introduces the new capital of Baghdad as the next site of
535 encounter, with the question: What were the multiple ways people of different
536 cultures interacted at sites of encounter, such as Baghdad? The teacher
537 asks students to think about what they have just studied about the spread of the
538 Muslim Empire as one way people of different cultures interact. That is, Arabs,
539 who were nomadic tribesmen from Arabia, converted to a new religion, and 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
258
540 inspired by that religion, fought wars against other cultures. One type of cultural
541 interaction is war. After the conquest, people of other cultures had to live under
542 Umayyad Muslim rule and pay special taxes if they belonged to another religion.
543 This type of cultural interaction is called coexistence in communities. Another
544 type is adoption and adaptation. Some of these conquered people adopted the
545 new religion for various reasons, such as religious conversion, access to political
546 power, and socio-economic advantages. As they converted, they changed their
547 names, their social identity, and associated with Muslims in their area, rather
548 than with their home group of Jews, Christians, or others. Over time, they
549 adopted more of Arab culture as well. However, as they adopted the Muslim
550 religion and Arab culture, they also adapted religious and cultural practices to
551 accommodate local customs. For example, the custom of secluding elite women
552 inside a special part of the house and only allowing them to go out when their
553 hair and most of their bodies were covered predates the religion of Islam. It was
554 actually a Persian and Mediterranean (and ancient Athenian) custom. Before
555 Islam, Arabian women were not confined to the household. The Persians and
556 Mediterranean people who converted to Islam adapted social practices to include
557 their custom. This is just one example of the cultural adaptation process.
558 Under the Abbasids, Baghdad grew from an insignificant village to one of the
559 leading cities of the world. The city’s culture was a mix of Arab, Persian, Indian,
560 Turkish, and Central Asian culture. The Abbasids encouraged the growth of
561 learning and borrowing from Greek, Hellenistic, and Indian science and medicine.
562 They built schools and libraries, translated and preserved Greek philosophic, 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
259
563 scientific, and medical texts, and supported scientists who expanded that
564 knowledge. In Baghdad and other Muslim-ruled cities, Muslim, Christian, and
565 Jewish scholars collaborated to study ancient Greek, Persian, and Indian
566 writings, forging and widely disseminating a more advanced synthesis of
567 philosophical, scientific, mathematical, geographic, artistic, medical, and literary
568 knowledge. To investigate the question: What did the interaction of Arab,
569 Persian, Greek, Hellenistic, and Indian ideas and technologies at Baghdad
570 (and the Abbasid caliphate) produce? students analyze visuals of libraries,
571 schools, and scientific drawings from Muslim manuscripts, the circulation of
572 “Arabic” numerals, and words of Arabic origin (such as algebra, candy, mattress,
573 rice). The teacher sets up a gallery walk and provides student groups with a
574 source analysis template. The template asks students to record source
575 information, describe the contents of the visual, and cite evidence from the visual
576 that answers the lesson question. Students share some of their observations and
577 answers to the whole class, as the teacher lists the products on the board. Then
578 the teacher guides students through developing a one-sentence interpretation
579 that answers the question. The students then return to their groups to discuss the
580 evidence they have gathered. The teacher stresses that they should choose the
581 best two pieces of evidence from their gallery walk. The group chooses two
582 pieces of evidence and each group member completes an evidence analysis
583 chart (with columns for evidence, meaning, significance, and source). The
584 teacher displays several group charts on the elmo, clears up any 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
260
585 misconceptions, and showcases examples of good evidence choices, analyses,
586 and citations.
587 After 900, the Abbasid Empire began to fragment into many smaller states.
588 However, the common knowledge of Arabic, the pilgrimage to Mecca, and
589 extensive trade and travel unified the Muslim world. Islam continued to spread,
590 sometimes by conquest, but also by the missionary work of Sufis and traveling
591 Muslim merchants. Sufi saints and teachers combined local and Islamic
592 traditions, and inspired common people on the frontier areas of the Muslim world
593 – east Africa, Southeast Asia, and India – to convert.
The History Blueprint is a free curriculum developed by the California HistorySocial

literacy and understanding of history. Three units are available for free download
from the CHSSP’s website, including Sites of Encounter in the Medieval World, a
comprehensive standards-aligned unit for seventh-grade teachers that combines
carefully selected and excerpted primary sources, original content, and
substantive support for student literacy development. For more information or to

595 The teacher now tells students that they are going to look at Western
596 Christendom and the World of Islam together through studying the site of
597 encounter in twelfth-century Norman Sicily, using the History Blueprint’s Sites of
598 Encounter in the Medieval World unit, starting with the question: Why was 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
261
599 Norman Sicily a site of encounter? Because of its geographical location,
600 multicultural population and tolerant rulers, the Norman kingdom of Sicily was a
601 major site of exchange among Muslims, Jews, Latin Roman Christians, and
602 Greek Byzantine Christians in the twelfth century. At the same time, Latin
603 Christian crusaders were battling with Syrian, Arab, Egyptian, and North African
604 Muslim warriors over territory and religious differences. Whereas in the past
605 historians placed emphasis on religious differences and the Crusades, historians
606 now emphasize the common features of these Mediterranean cultures and the
607 many ways in which Christians, Muslims, and Jews interacted. The Sicily lesson
608 reflects this new world history approach to the medieval Mediterranean. Rather
609 than directly teaching one interpretation, the teacher presents the primary
610 sources, guides students through analyzing them and gathering evidence, and
611 asks students to form their own interpretation to answer the question: Was there
612 more trade (with peace and tolerance) or conflict (especially conflict
613 between religious groups)? Students investigate Al-Idrisi’s world map, excerpts
614 from Geoffrey Malaterra and Ibn Jubayr, documents from the Cairo Geniza and
615 the Venetian archives, lists of trade goods, and visuals of objects created and
616 sold in Sicily through map activities, close readings, a gallery walk, and
617 discussion. Students analyze the content of the lesson in a graphic organizer that
618 also introduces them to the concept of cause-and-effect historical reasoning.
619 The central position of Islamic world in Afroeurasia became increasingly
620 important as trade and exchange expanded. Muslim merchants, scholars and
621 Sufis traveled between the great cities, such as Córdoba, Damascus and Cairo, 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
262
622 which produced luxury goods such as steel swords and embroidered silk capes.
623 Students investigate the question: How did the Muslim empires and
624 institutions help different regions of Afroeurasia become more
625 interconnected? through the second site of encounter in the History Blueprint
626 lesson, Cairo in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Cairo was at the center of
627 the network of roads, sea routes, and cities that supported trade and pilgrimage
628 in the Islamic world, making it one of the most important trade cities in
629 Afroeurasia. Students work with the Sites of Encounter in the Medieval World
630 interactive map either online or through the teacher’s projection to make an
631 interpretation about the question: Looking at its geographic position, what
632 advantages did Cairo have as a trade city? Either individually or in pairs,
633 students read a secondary informative text, “Cairo Background Reading,” answer
634 text-dependent questions, and, in a group, summarize the main ideas of the text
635 in a cause-and-effect graphic organizer around the question: What were the
636 effects of the exchanges at Cairo? The Islamic world was a network of cities
637 that was tied together by common religion, pilgrimage, trade, and intellectual
638 culture. Islamic institutions, such as the pilgrimage (or hajj), caravans,
639 caravanserais, funduqs, souqs, and madrassas, and favorable policies of city
640 and state governments provided major assistance to merchants and travelers. In
641 a gallery walk of primary-source visuals of and text excerpts about these
642 institutions, students gather and analyze evidence using an evidence analysis
643 chart. The same routes also transmitted technologies and food plants. For
644 example, paper-making technology reached the Southwestern Asia from China 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
263
645 around the eighth century and spread from there to Europe in the following 300
646 years. Food plants, including sugar cane, oranges, melons, eggplants, and
647 spinach, were diffused widely along the exchange routes. Lesson three of the
648 California EEI Curriculum Unit, “Arabic Trade Networks,” helps students analyze
649 the circulation of regional products throughout Afroeurasia. Less positive things
650 also spread along trade routes, such as the bubonic plague. The Black Death of
651 the 1300s killed millions in China and caused the population of Europe and the
652 Muslim world to plummet temporarily by about a third. In the Cairo lesson,
653 students read primary sources from Ibn Battuta, Agnolo di Tura, and al-Maqrizi
654 describing the impact of the Black Death of 1348-1350 in Europe and the Muslim
655 world.
656 Using the information from the lesson sources, graphic organizers and
657 evidence analysis charts, students write an argumentative paragraph on the
658 question: Which of the effects of the exchanges at Cairo do you think was
659 the most important? They make a claim, state their reasons, and support the
660 reasons with evidence from the primary sources. The “Effects Paragraph”
661 assignment has sentence starters for the claim and reasons and an evidence
662 analysis chart that helps student paraphrase, analyze, and cite evidence. For
663 English Learners, there are also sentence frames with appropriate academic and
664 disciplinary language to paraphrase, analyze, and cite the two pieces of
665 evidence. After providing feedback to students on their claims, reasons, and use
666 and analysis of evidence, the teacher concludes by telling students that they will
667 be returning to the Islamic trade and pilgrimage network in future units. Muslim

668 merchants eventually traded from China to the Mediterranean, and Jewish
669 merchants also traded freely in the Muslim world. They established communities
670 across Afroeurasia that were connected by family ties and trade connections.
671
672 South Asia, 300 to 1200
673 • Under the Gupta Empire, how did the environment, cultural and religious
674 changes, and technological innovations affect the people of India?
675 • How did Indian monks, nuns, merchants, travelers, and states spread
676 religious ideas and practices and cultural styles of art and architecture to
677 Central and Southeast Asia?
678 • How did the religions of Hinduism and Buddhism spread and change over
679 time?
680 The Gupta monarchs reunified much of the subcontinent in the third century
681 CE, ushering in the Classical Age of India. As they study the question: Under the
682 Gupta Empire, how did the environment, cultural and religious changes,
683 and technological innovations affect the people of India? students learn that
684 the Gupta dynasty (280-550 CE) presided over a rich period of religious, socio-
685 economic, educational, literary, and scientific development, including the base-
686 ten numerical system and the concept of zero. The level of interaction in all
687 aspects of life–commercial, cultural, religious–among the people of various parts
688 of India was intensive and widespread during this time period, much more so
689 than in earlier periods. This helped produce a common Indic culture that unified
690 the people of the subcontinent. Buddhist monasteries and Hindu temples and 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
265
691 schools spread. Sanskrit became the principal literary language throughout India.
692 Enduring contributions of ancient Indian civilization to other areas of Afroeurasia
693 include the cotton textile industry, the technology of crystalizing sugar,
694 astronomical treatises, the practice of monasticism, the game of chess, and the
695 art, architecture, and performing arts of the Classical Age. Students analyze
696 maps of the extent of the Gupta Empire and visuals of its achievements in
697 science, math, art, architecture, and Sanskrit literature. After the fall of the Gupta
698 Empire, India had many states. The Chola Empire ruled over much of southern
699 India and established maritime commercial trading networks throughout much of
700 the Indian Ocean. The Chola are associated with significant artistic achievement
701 that included the building of monumental Hindu temples and the creation of
702 remarkable sculptures and bronzes.
Building on their previous study of Hinduism in 6th 703 grade, students study the
704 question: How did Hinduism change over time? Hinduism continued to evolve
705 with the Bhakti movement, which emphasized personal expression of devotion to
706 God, who had three aspects: Brahma, the creator, Vishnu, the protector, and
707 Siva, the transformer. The Bhakti movement placed emphasis on social and
708 religious equality and a personal expression of devotion to God in the popular,
709 vernacular languages. People of all social groups now had personal access to
710 their own personal deities, whom they could worship with songs, dances,
711 processions, and temple visits. Bhakti grew more popular, thanks to saints such
712 as Meera Bai and Ramananda. Even though India was not unified into one state,
713 nor did its people belong to a single religion, the entire area was developing a 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
266
714 cultural unity.
715 Students next examine this question: How did Indian monks, nuns,
716 merchants, travelers, and states spread religious ideas and practices and
717 cultural styles of art and architecture to Central and Southeast Asia? During
718 and after the Gupta Empire, trade connections between India and Southeast Asia
719 facilitated the spread of Hindu and Buddhist ideas to Srivijaya, a large trading
720 empire after 600, Java, and the Khmer Empire. In the Sites of Encounter in the
721 Medieval World Lesson 6: Calicut, the “Indian and Southeast Asian Art” activity
722 has students compare art and architecture from India and Southeast Asia. When
723 students have compiled their evidence, the teacher asks them why they think
724 Southeast Asian rulers would adopt religious ideas and artistic styles from Indian
725 kingdoms. After they share their interpretations, the teacher points out that pre-
726 modern rulers displayed their power through temples and that the architectural
727 similarities among the temples are evidence of a shared culture of rulership in the
728 region. In addition to personal religious motives, Southeast Asian kings could
729 build up their prestige and legitimacy by adopting the cultural, religious, and
730 artistic styles of the powerful and prestigious Indian kingdoms and empires.
731 Next students examine the question: How did Buddhism spread and
732 change over time? Buddhist missionaries and travelers carried Buddhism from
733 India to Central Asia and then to China, as well as to Southeast Asia, during this
734 period as well. At the same time, Christian and Muslim missionaries were also
735 spreading their religions. As it moved outside of India and became a universal
736 religion, Buddhism changed. In 600 BCE, Buddha was sage, a wise man; but by

737 300 CE, his followers were worshipping the Buddha as a god. Nirvana changed
738 from “nothingness” or “extinction” to a kind of heaven for believers in the afterlife.
739 Mahayana Buddhists also added the idea that there were bodhisattvas, divine
740 souls who delayed entering nirvana to help others on earth. Either here, or in the
741 China unit, students trace the journey of Xuanzang, who departed from China in
742 627 CE on pilgrimage to Buddhist holy sites in India. He returned home with 527
743 boxes of Buddhist texts, which he devoted the rest of his life to translating. The
744 building of monasteries along the Silk Road, at Dunhuang, Yungang and
745 Bamiyan, helped transmit texts, people, and religious ideas through Central to
746 East Asia.
747 After 1000, Turks from Central Asia, who were recent converts to Islam,
748 began to conquer states in northwestern India. Sometimes Turkish Muslim
749 leaders forced Hindus to convert, but at other times rulers practiced religious
750 toleration. The most powerful of these states was the Delhi Sultanate. Islam
751 became firmly established politically in the north as well as in some coastal towns
752 and parts of the Deccan Plateau, although the majority of the population of South
753 Asia remained Hindu. There were continuous close trade relations and
754 intellectual connections between India and the Islamic World. As a concrete
755 example of cultural transmission, students may trace the Gupta advances in
756 astronomy and mathematics (particularly the numeral system which included a
757 place value of ten) to the work of al-Khwarizmi, a Persian mathematician of the
758 ninth century, who applied the base-ten numerical system pioneered in India to
759 the study of algebra, a word derived from the Arabic al-jabr, meaning

760 “restoration.” As trade grew along the sea-routes of the Indian Ocean, India
761 became a major producer of cotton cloth, spices, and other commodities with a
762 volume of exports second only to China.

764 East Asia, 300-1300: China and Japan
765 • How did the Tang and Song dynasties gain and maintain power over
766 people and territories?
767 • How did the environmental conditions and technological innovations cause
768 the medieval economic revolution? What were the effects of this
769 revolution?
770 • Why was Quanzhou such an important site of encounter?
771 • How did Chinese culture, ideas, and technologies and Buddhism influence
772 Korea and Japan?
773 • What influence did samurai customs and values have on the government
774 and society of medieval Japan?
775 From 300 to 1300 CE, China had a larger population and economy than any
776 other major region of the world. Students begin their study with the question:
777 How did the Tang and Song dynasties gain and maintain power over people
778 and territories? After a long period of disunity, the Sui (589-618) and Tang
779 dynasties (618-907) reunited China. The Tang rulers rebuilt a government
780 modeled on the Han dynasty. Scholar-officials, trained in Confucianism, advised
781 the emperor and administered the empire. Confucian principles specified that
782 government should operate as a strict hierarchy of authority from the emperor,

783 who enjoyed the “Mandate of Heaven” as long as he ruled justly, down to the
784 local village official. The Tang had an active foreign policy and spread their
785 influence along the Silk Road to the west, as far as the border of the Abbasid
786 Caliphate. The two empires fought a battle in Central Asia in 751, from which the
787 Chinese retreated. The Tang dynasty extended influence and cultural pressure
788 on Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. The Song dynasty took over in 960. The Song
789 supervised strong cultural and economic growth, with magnificent cities and
790 cultural productions. The Visual Sourcebook of Chinese Civilization website has
791 visuals and interactive activities to help students analyze primary sources from
792 the Song and other dynasties. The Song instituted an official examination system
793 for scholar-officials, which gave China a civil service bureaucracy many centuries
794 before any other state. China had the strongest and most centralized government
795 in the world. However, the Song struggled militarily against nomadic tribes from
796 the north. One group of nomads overran the Northern Song region and captured
797 the emperor. Survivors of the Song imperial family maintained the Southern Song
798 Empire from 1126 to 1260, when they fell to the Mongols. Under the pressure
799 from the loss of the north to “barbarians,” the Southern Song emphasized the
800 superiority of Chinese traditions.
801 Despite these military problems, China became Afroeurasia’s major economic
802 powerhouse in this period, due to the medieval economic revolution. Students
803 analyze the question: How did the environmental conditions and
804 technological innovations cause the medieval economic revolution? What
805 were the effects of this revolution? Cause-and-effect graphic organizers help

806 students analyze the many factors that contributed to the Chinese economic
807 revolution that occurred between the seventh and thirteenth centuries. The
808 factors of population growth, expansion of agriculture, urbanization, spread of
809 manufacturing, and technological innovation were both causes and effects of the
810 economic revolution, as each factor intensified the effects of the others. The
811 economic revolution began with the introduction (from Vietnam) of champa rice, a
812 variety that produces two crops per year. Farmers migrated to the Yangzi River
813 valley to take advantage of the increased yield, and the population grew rapidly.
814 Chinese laborers and merchants extended the empire’s system of canals
815 connecting navigable rivers to about 30,000 miles. The system was financed by
816 state taxes on trade, and led to even more trade. Blast furnaces quadrupled the
817 output of iron and steel in the eleventh century alone. Availability of steel enabled
818 increased production in other industries. Technicians experimented with
819 gunpowder rockets and bombs. Woodblock printing became a standard industry,
820 and printed books circulated widely. The hundreds of inventions of the Tang and
821 Song eras included the magnetic compass, advanced kilns for firing porcelain,
822 and wheels for spinning silk. In California EEI Curriculum Unit, “Genius Across
823 the Centuries,” students research five important Chinese inventions of this period
824 (tea, the manufacture of paper, wood-block printing, the compass, and
825 gunpowder), examine a map of China’s natural regions, identify the sources of
826 raw materials used in each invention, and evaluate the influence of these
827 Chinese inventions on the natural systems of medieval China. The teacher points
828 out the similarity of the agricultural revolution in Medieval Christendom at about

271
829 the same time (ca. 1000). In both cases, improvements in farming technology led
830 the way, and growth in trade, inventions, cities, and population resulted. Both
831 cultures benefited from increased Afroeurasian trade as well.
832 Students then investigate this question: Why did Quanzhou become such
833 an important site of encounter? Located on China’s southeast coast,
834 Quanzhou was a primary destination for Arab, Persian, Indian, and Southeast
835 Asian ships carrying merchants eager to buy China’s famed porcelain and silk.
836 Because of its extensive internal economy and technological advances, China
837 exported more than it imported. Although the land route to China was sometimes
838 difficult to travel, shipping to and from the southeast coast meant that China was
839 never isolated from outside world. China was also the largest and most
840 centralized state in the medieval world, and government regulations of merchants
841 and foreigners were more thorough. As one of the official trade cities of the
842 Chinese empire, Quanzhou had large foreign communities. In this lesson,
843 students compare the accounts of Ibn Battuta, Marco Polo, and Zhao Rugua
844 about Quanzhou for their multiple points of view on trade and cultural exchange.
845 They write an essay answering the focus question and citing evidence from the
846 primary sources. Students analyze a concrete example of cross-cultural
847 production in the porcelain vases and flasks made in China for export to the
848 Muslim world and Spain.

272
In Ms. Hutton’s seventh-grade world history class, students are learning about
medieval world history. They do this by touring Sites of Encounter, or places of
exchange, in the medieval world. Quanzhou, located on China’s southeast coast,
and one of the largest and busiest ports in the world, is a centerpiece in Ms.
Hutton’s classroom. Students in Ms. Hutton’s class have learned how Quanzhou
was a prime destination for Arab, Persian, Indian, and Southeast Asian ships
carrying merchants eager to buy China’s famed porcelain and silk. As one of the
official trade cities of the Chinese empire (which was the largest and most
centralized state in the medieval world), Quanzhou had large foreign
communities.
As an important part of learning about Quanzhou as a Site of Encounter,
students in Ms. Hutton’s class participate in a guided discussion about the city’s
laws, customs, and multicultural coexistence. Students practice Common Core
and ELD discussion skills based on excerpts from primary-source documents to
answer this discussion question: How did laws and customs help people from
different cultures live together in Quanzhou?
First, Ms. Hutton divides the class up into groups of three or four. Each
student in the group is asked to read one or two primary sources, write a short
summary of the document, and highlight evidence that helps answer the
discussion question on a graphic organizer. To support students’ interrogation of
their sources, she asks them questions like, “Who benefited from this law or
custom? Did the law or custom make people feel safe and welcome? Did it keep 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
273
people from cheating or causing trouble?”
Ms. Hutton then directs her students to share out what they’ve written with
their group. To support student discussion, Ms. Hutton provides various
discussion starters designed to start the conversation, such as, “My document is
about…,” “This law / custom kept people from cheating by…,” “This law/custom
helped people from different cultures live together because…,” and “The
evidence that supports my idea is….” She also provides starters that can be used
to respond to conversation, such as, “Tell me more about…,” “What evidence do
you have?” “How did you come to that conclusion?”
After all group members have shared, Ms. Hutton’s students collectively try to
formulate an interpretation (or main idea) that answers the discussion question
based on all of the evidence. She offers additional sentence starters to support
this part of the discussion, such as “Document xx does not seem to fit with the
other documents, because …,” “Document xx seems to support the ideas in
document xxx …,” “I agree / disagree with what Carmen said, because …,”
“Does the evidence about your law /custom support the interpretation that …,”
and “Where is the evidence to support this interpretation?”
After each group has formulated an interpretation, Ms. Hutton debriefs the
students as a whole class using these questions to lead the discussion: what is
your interpretation, what evidence supports this interpretation, and what evidence
contradicts this interpretation? She circulates the room during the conversations
to evaluate, and redirect if necessary, her students’ ability to make an oral 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft

274
argument in response to the discussion question. As she listens to their
conversation, Ms. Hutton considers her students’ ability to marshal relevant
evidence in support of their argument, their use of academic language, and their
overall understanding of the specific content in this lesson.

850 Buddhism spread widely and gained many followers in China during the Tang
851 period and began to alter religious life in neighboring Korea and Japan as well.
852 Students return to the question: How did Buddhism spread and change over
853 time? In China Buddhist ideas intermingled with those of Daoism, a Chinese
854 religion emphasizing private spirituality, and Confucianism, the belief system that
855 stressed moral and ethical behavior. At its height in the ninth century, Buddhism
856 had 50,000 monasteries in China. As Confucian scholar-officials and Daoist
857 priests felt threatened by this “foreign religion,” the Tang emperors reversed their
858 earlier acceptance of Buddhism and began to persecute it. One result of this 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
275
859 persecution is that Buddhism did not become the official religion of China.
860 Instead, Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist beliefs and practices fused together in
861 China to form a syncretic popular religion, emphasizing moral living, daily ritual,
862 and dedication to family and community.
863 Students turn their attention to the question: How did Chinese culture,
864 ideas, and technologies and Buddhism influence Korea and Japan? Under
865 the Tang dynasty, China expanded its trade and cultural influence to Korea,
866 Japan, and Southeast Asia. At sites of encounter, these societies adopted and
867 adapted Chinese ideas and institutions and combined those with their own ideas
868 and institutions to build distinct civilizations. This is the adoption and adaptation
869 form of cultural encounter. In the fourth century, three kingdoms emerged to rule
870 the Korean population, and in 670, one of those kingdoms, Silla, unified the
871 whole peninsula. Silla was closely connected to the Tang dynasty of China.
872 Korean elites used Chinese as a written language, but later devised a phonetic
873 script for the Korean language. In 936, the Koryo kingdom took over rule in
874 Korea, and adopted a civil service exam system copied after that of China.
875 Korean merchants were engaged in trade with Japan and China, and through
876 those networks, to Indian Ocean and Afroeurasian trade networks as well. The
877 Korea Society powerpoint, “Silla Korea and the Silk Road,” has images and
878 archaeological evidence that provide opportunities for students to analyze
879 cultural interaction and trade across Eurasia.
880 In a similar manner, Japan was influenced by China and Korea, but adapted
881 outside institutions and ideas to fit with its own indigenous culture. Before the 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft

276
882 sixth century, Japan was an agricultural society ruled by land-holding clan
883 chieftains. Their religion, Shinto, emphasized the influence of the supernatural
884 world and spirits of the ancestors. One clan rose above the others, founded a
885 central state and a dynasty called the Yamato. Those rulers claimed the title of
886 “heavenly sovereign,” or emperor. About 850 CE, the Yamato rulers lost their grip
887 on political affairs, and aristocratic palace families assumed real power. The
888 emperors retained their throne but played mainly a ritual role. The pattern of
889 aristocratic clans warring and succeeding one another as rulers under the
890 sovereignty of a ceremonial but powerless emperor continued into modern times.
891 Between the third and sixth centuries, when China was politically fragmented,
892 many Chinese and Koreans migrated to Japan in search of refuge or opportunity.
893 Those newcomers introduced many innovations, including advanced metallurgy,
894 writing, silk production, textile manufacture, paper-making, and Buddhism.
895 Japanese tradition links the introduction of Buddhism and beginning of Chinese
896 cultural influence with Prince Shokotu (574-622). China’s immense power under
897 the Tang Dynasty stimulated Japanese interest in Chinese and Korean culture.
898 Literary scholars, officials, and Buddhist monks traveled to Japan. In turn,
899 Japanese intellectuals went west to seek knowledge, learn Confucian statecraft,
900 and acquire Buddhist texts, some made in Korea with some of the earliest known
901 wood-block printing technology. The Japanese gradually adapted Buddhism to fit
902 with older Shinto practices. For example, Shinto nature gods became associated
903 with Buddhist spirits and saints. The Zen school of Buddhism spread widely
904 among laboring men and women.

277
905 From about 1000 CE, the Japanese aristocratic class creatively combined
906 Chinese and Korean ideas with Japanese ways to form a new civilization with
907 distinctive institutions, literature, and arts. Japanese officials adopted rules of
908 government derived from imperial China but tailored them to their own smaller
909 population and territory. Scholars developed a writing system that used simplified
910 Chinese characters to represent Japanese sounds. Moreover, several
911 aristocratic women wrote literary works in Japanese. Students may read
912 selections from the Tale of Genji, a novel about a courtier’s life written by Lady
913 Murasaki Shikibu sometime between 990 and 1012.
914 Even though China had a great influence on Japan, Japanese government
915 and society developed in its own direction. Students investigate the question:
916 What influence did samurai customs and values have on the government
917 and society of medieval Japan? Japan had an emperor, but the emperor and
918 his court had no real power. Clans continued to control regional areas of Japan.
919 Important clans fought each other for more land, power, and control over the
920 weak central government. In the 1180s, the Miramoto clan dominated Japan.
921 They instituted a military government headed by a “great general,” or shogun.
922 The highest social status in the clan and in society went to the samurai,
923 professional fighters. Most samurai were vassals of clan leaders, or daimyo, in a
924 system that was similar to feudal lordship in Christendom at the same time.
925 Samurai were dedicated to a code of courage, honor, and martial skill. To
926 analyze samurai culture, students read The Tale of the Heike and view
927 woodblock prints. The Asia for Educators website has a short excerpt of this 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
278
928 story of samurai warfare, and there are many woodblock prints on the Web,
929 although most date from later periods. During those centuries, Japan’s
930 agriculture, population, and urbanization continued to expand. Exchanges with
931 China and Korea grew, as merchants traded luxury goods in return for Japanese
932 silver, copper, timber, and steel swords. By 1300, East Asia was an
933 interconnected region dominated economically and culturally by China.

935 The Americas, 300-1490
936 • How did the environment affect the expansion of agriculture, population,
937 cities, and empires in Mesoamerica and the Andean region?
938 • Why did the Maya civilization, the Aztec Empire and the Inca Empire gain
939 more power over people and territories?
940 • How did Mesoamerican religion develop and change over time?
941 • Under the Aztecs, why was Tenochtitlán a site of encounter?
942 To begin their study of civilizations in the Americas, students investigate the
943 question: How did the environment affect the expansion of agriculture,
944 population, cities, and empires in Mesoamerica and the Andean region?
945 One important environmental factor was the separation of the Americas and
946 Afroeurasia after 15,000 BCE. As a result, different ecosystems developed in the
947 Americas than in Afroeurasia. The Americas had no beasts of burden; corn was
948 the major staple rather than rice or wheat. A second environmental factor is the
949 sheer size and variety of habitats in the Americas. The north-south axis of the
950 Americas extends nearly 11,000 miles, from the frigid Arctic rim to the equatorial 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft

279
951 rain forests of the Amazon River basin to Tierra Del Fuego at the southern tip of
952 South America. A mountain spine runs nearly the entire length, and divides the
953 Americas longitudinally, separating narrow coastal plains on the Pacific from
954 broad plains on the eastern side that stretch toward the Atlantic. Several great
955 river systems, especially the Mississippi and the Amazon, have been channels of
956 human communication since ancient times. Thousands of different cultures,
957 speaking many different languages and following different customs, lived on the
958 two continents. Their ways of life varied from gathering and hunting to agrarian-
959 urban states. Lesson 2 or 4 of the California EEI Curriculum Unit “Sun Gods and
960 Jaguar Kings” guides students through the landforms and climate zones that
961 formed the environment for the two urbanized regions of the Americas.
962 Agriculture developed independently in Mesoamerica and the Andean
963 highlands after 3000 BCE. Farming and village settlement spread through those
964 regions and by the second millennium BCE, the Olmec civilization appeared in
965 Mesoamerica and the Chávin civilization in the central Andes. Unlike
966 Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, or India, these civilizations did not develop along
967 great rivers. The catalyst for developing the Olmec civilization may have been
968 surplus farming produce, population growth, or increasing trade. Connected by
969 exchange of crops and products from the ocean, the lowlands, the highlands,
970 and the rainforest, the Chávin civilization extended across the high Andes range
971 to the lowlands on either side. After the Olmec and Chavín fell, other civilizations
972 took their place or grew up nearby. The Maya, Aztec, and Inca Empires built on
973 the culture and accomplishments of two thousand years of previous civilizations.

974 Between about 200 to 900 CE, the Maya region of southern Mexico,
975 Guatemala, and Belize had more than fifty independent city-states. The students
976 focus on this question: Why did the Maya civilization gain power over people
977 and territories? The teacher points out that although the Maya built on a basis
978 of civilizations before them, the Maya city-states built larger and grander
979 buildings, developed advanced writing, mathematics and astronomy, and had a
980 more hierarchical and wealthy society. Two factors that gave the Maya power
981 were rich agriculture and widespread trade. Among the largest cities were Tikal
982 in Guatemala and Calakmul in Mexico. Maya societies produced monumental
983 architecture, astronomic observatories, a pictographic writing system that yielded
984 libraries of thousands of books, and a sophisticated calendar system based on a
985 fifty-two-year cycle. These innovations would have given the Maya society strong
986 cultural power, because many neighboring people would have been impressed.
987 Students may compare mathematical systems that developed in Afroeurasia with
988 Maya mathematics, which utilized positional notation, the concept of zero, and a
989 base-20 numerical system. The monarchs and aristocratic families who ruled
990 these city-states kept order and defended their lands in wars with other city-
991 states. They also performed elaborate religious rituals to conciliate the gods who,
992 Mayans believed, commanded the rain and sun. These rituals included blood-
993 letting by members of the elite and royal families. The elites drew blood from their
994 own bodies to offer to the gods. The Maya also sacrificed enemies captured in
995 battle (instead of killing them on the battlefield). Farmers, artisans, and hunters
996 paid taxes and supplied labor for construction of public temples, palaces, and 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
281
997 ceremonial ball courts. After about 750 CE, warfare intensified among city-states,
998 monumental construction diminished, and cities were gradually abandoned.
999 Deforestation, erosion, and drought may have contributed to their decline.
1000 The Aztec Empire emerged in the fifteenth century. Initially, students focus
1001 on: Why did the Aztec Empire gain more power over people and territories?
1002 The Aztecs, a people who originally migrated from northern Mexico, owed a
1003 strong cultural debt to the Maya, Teotihuacán, and the Toltec cities in
1004 Mesoamerica. The Aztecs won their power by warfare. They unified much of
1005 central Mexico by defeating all other powerful cities and states. They created a
1006 state based on ingenious methods of farming, collection of tribute from
1007 conquered peoples, and an extensive network of markets and trade routes.
1008 Next students investigate the question: How did Mesoamerican religion
1009 change over time? The Aztec practiced ritual sacrifice of war captives (instead
1010 of killing them on the battlefield), but to a greater extent than the Maya had. The
1011 Aztecs believed that the god of the sun would stop shining and the universe
1012 would collapse without a constant supply of human hearts and blood. Comparing
1013 Maya and Aztec practices shows students how the Mesoamerican religion
1014 changed over time. Students may analyze visuals from Aztec tribute records, the
1015 Florentine Codex, and other codices made in the early Spanish period. Lesson 5
1016 of the California EEI Curriculum Unit “Sun Gods and Jaguar Kings” has an
1017 excellent activity based on the Aztec tribute records as sources. Ultimately, the
1018 resentment of conquered people made the Aztec Empire unstable.
1019 Students also study the question: Under the Aztecs, why was Tenochtitlán 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
282
1020 a site of encounter? This is the first part of their study, as they will return to
1021 “Mexico City” as a site of encounter in the Global Convergence unit. Tenochtitlán
1022 was built on an island in Lake Texcoco, with three causeways linking it to the
1023 mainland. The city was built in circles, with temples and government buildings in
1024 an inner square, houses in the outer circles, and floating garden beds on the lake
1025 around the city. It was one of the largest cities in the world at that time. Its
1026 markets contained vast amounts and variety of goods from all over
1027 Mesoamerica.
1028 Students compare the Aztec empire with the Inca state that arose in Andean
1029 South America, with the question: Why did the Inca Empire gain power over
1030 people and territories? Like the Aztecs, the Incas built on a series of earlier
1031 civilizations, but combined cities and states together into a larger empire than
1032 any before in that region. The Inca rulers built a highly centralized political
1033 system that included methods of food distribution in times of poor harvests. They
1034 also created a network of about 25,000 miles of government-controlled roads that
1035 ran along the Andes spine and served military, administrative, and commercial
1036 purposes. The Incas did rely on military power but they also offered important
1037 social benefits to the population. In contrast to the Aztecs, the Incas did not have
1038 a writing system, but they used Andean quipus, or sets of colored and knotted
1039 strings, to keep complex records. To conclude this unit, students can meet in
1040 groups and prepare graphic organizers comparing power, religion, social
1041 customs, agriculture, intellectual developments, and trade in each culture.

1043 West Africa, 900-1400
1044 • How did the environment affect the development and expansion of the
1045 Ghana and Mali empires and the trade networks that connected them to
1046 the rest of Afroeurasia?
1047 • Why was Mali a site of encounter? What were the effects of the
1048 exchanges at Mali?
1049 • How did Arab/North African and West African perspectives differ on West
1050 African kingdoms?
1051 As of 500 CE, groups of farming and animal-herding peoples lived in West
1052 Africa, a region with four large zones of climate and vegetation running west to
1053 east. Students begin with the question: How did the environment affect the
1054 development and expansion of the Ghana and Mali empires and the trade
1055 networks that connected them to the rest of Afroeurasia? The most northerly
1056 belt is the intensely arid Sahara, home to oasis-dwellers and pastoral nomads.
1057 Just south of the desert is the semiarid Sahel zone, where cattle and camel
1058 herding predominated. Third is the tropical grassland, or savanna, which had
1059 sufficient rainfall to support farmers and their fields of rice, sorghum, and millet.
1060 In the far south is the wet tropical forest. There, settled life depended on
1061 cultivation of root crops and other forest foods. In the Sahel and savanna,
1062 agriculture and herding supported the growth of regional trade. Tracing a great
1063 arc across West Africa, the Niger River provided a natural highway of
1064 communication linking different ecological zones. Farming, trade, and early
1065 development of iron smelting stimulated town building. The city of Jenne-jeno, 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
284
1066 built in the early centuries CE, was home to artisans who produced iron tools,
1067 copperware, gold jewelry, and fine painted ceramics.
1068 In addition to local markets, West Africa contained rich deposits of gold. Both
1069 Muslim and Christian rulers and traders in the Mediterranean region craved
1070 African gold, notably for coinage. West African merchants acquired gold from
1071 mines in the Sudan and shipped it to towns in the Sahel, where Arab and Berber
1072 merchants carried the gold north on trans-Saharan camel caravan routes. Some
1073 of this African bullion then flowed into Europe or eastward toward India. Students
1074 use the Sites of Encounter in the Medieval World interactive map to investigate
1075 these environmental factors. Then they read Ibn Battuta’s account of the perilous
1076 crossing of the Sahara in an excerpt from the Mali lesson of the “Sites of
1077 Encounter in the Medieval World” unit. They read the text individually first, then
1078 meet in group to discuss and report on one paragraph of the reading, and finally
1079 read the text again and answer text-dependent questions.
1080 The centralized state of Ghana emerged around the eighth century in the
1081 western part of the Sahel zone. The king of Ghana commanded a large royal
1082 household, a hierarchy of officials, and an army of infantry archers. The Ghana
1083 empire had Muslim officials, though the kings probably did not convert. Ghana
1084 slowly crumbled in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, but around 1240, Mali
1085 emerged to rule over a large part of the western Sudan. Mali’s rulers
1086 accumulated wealth collecting tribute from African farmers and taxing trans-
1087 Saharan trade. The royal court employed staffs of both foreign and native-born
1088 Muslims as administrators, and Arabic became the written language of

Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
285
1089 government and diplomacy. Most of the kings and their officials professed Islam
1090 and introduced Islamic law, though most of West Africa’s population adhered to
1091 their local religions for several more centuries. In the 1300s Timbuktu, a city near
1092 the Niger River, rose as a regional center of trade and Islamic learning.
1093 The gold trade across the Sahara involved Ghana and Mali in Afroeurasian
1094 trade networks. Students focus on Mali with the question: What made Mali a site
1095 of encounter? What were the effects of the exchanges at Mali? Northbound
1096 caravans also shipped ivory, ostrich feathers, and slaves captured in raids and
1097 wars. Merchants marched these captives, including many women, to the
1098 Mediterranean or Middle East principally to serve in Muslim households. The
1099 southbound trade included salt from Saharan mines, a commodity that
1100 commanded huge demand in West Africa. Other southbound commodities
1101 included copper, horses, and Arabic books. Arabic- and Berber-speaking
1102 merchants from North Africa likely introduced Islam to West Africa in the eighth
1103 century. They established bonds with Sudanic traders, many of whom converted
1104 to the new faith. Even for those Africans who did not convert to Islam, Muslim
1105 culture had a significant impact on West African architecture, education, and
1106 languages. The “Sightseeing in Mali” gallery walk activity guides students
1107 through analyzing artifacts from Mali, such as mosques, statues of mounted
1108 warriors, an astronomy book, and the university at Timbuktu. The artifacts show
1109 that the West Africans adopted Muslim culture but also adapted it to fit their own
1110 culture.

1111 In order to probe more deeply into the history of West African kingdoms,
1112 students analyze this question: How did Arab/North African and West African
1113 perspectives differ on West African kingdoms? The “West African and
1114 Arab/North African Perspectives” activity contains excerpts from Arab/North
1115 African sources by al-Bakri, al-Umari, Ibn Khaldun, and Ibn Battuta, and one
1116 West African source, The Epic of Sundiata. All of the written sources about the
1117 West African kingdoms were written by Arab/North African writers, who thought
1118 that West African culture was more primitive than Arab culture. If the historian
1119 relies on their evidence alone, he or she would think that Islam and the gold trade
1120 were almost the creators of West African states. Students access a West African
1121 perspective in the Epic of Sundiata (Sunjata), a heroic king associated with the
1122 rise of Mali. The epic was passed down by griots in an oral tradition until the mid-
1123 twentieth century, when one version of it was recorded in writing. In the close
1124 reading activity, students learn how to identify perspective as they compare
1125 passages. At the conclusion of this lesson, students work with the Sites of
1126 Encounter in the Medieval World map to analyze the position of Mali in the
1127 Islamic world, and compare that position at the end of a single trade route and
1128 within a single trade circle with Cairo’s position at the center of many trade routes
1129 and three trade circles. A brief discussion on the differences between the cultural
1130 center and the periphery will introduce students to this geographical concept.

1133 • How did the Mongol Empire destroy states and increase the
1134 interconnection of Afroeurasia?
1135 • What were the effects of the exchanges at Majorca and Calicut?
1136 • How did increasing interconnection and trade, competition between states
1137 (and their people), and technological innovations lead to voyages of
1138 exploration?
1139 Around the year 1000 in Afroeurasia, technological innovations in agriculture
1140 caused massive increases in productivity, population growth, settlement of new
1141 lands, and a great expansion of manufacturing, trade, and urbanization. The
1142 agricultural revolution between the Tang and Song dynasties made China the
1143 center of industry, as it produced new inventions and luxury products desired
1144 throughout Afroeurasia. Innovations spurred a huge expansion of agriculture in
1145 Europe, cultivation of new lands, expansion of trade, and a rebirth of
1146 manufacturing, trade, urban culture, and education. Networks of commercial,
1147 technological and cultural exchange covered most of Afroeurasia. In the center,
1148 the Muslim world (now divided into many states) and India prospered as
1149 producers of goods such as cotton cloth, spices, and swords, and also as
1150 middlemen along the east-west trade routes. While people rarely traveled from
1151 Spain to China, products, technologies, and ideas did. From 1200 to 1490, those
1152 networks grew stronger, busier, and tighter.
1153 The attacks and domination of the Mongol Empire had a huge negative effect
1154 on states, empires, and many people of Eurasia, but it also greatly extended
1155 trade, travel, and exchange between Afroeurasian societies. The teacher

288
1156 introduces the question: How did the Mongol Empire destroy states and
1157 increase the interconnection of Afroeurasia? In the late twelfth century,
1158 nomadic warriors from the steppe and deserts north of China, the Mongol tribes
1159 (and other Central Asian nomadic tribes), were united by a charismatic leader,
1160 Chinggis (Genghis) Khan, who lead them to conquests across Eurasia. At its
1161 height, the Mongol Empire was the largest land empire in world history. Mongols
1162 were fierce and highly mobile fighters who terrified the people they conquered,
1163 even though their numbers were small. Students examine maps of the Mongol
1164 conquests and empire, and compare these with the Sites of Encounter in the
1165 Medieval World interactive map, which has physical, religious, political and other
1166 maps of Afroeurasia. After Chinggis Khan’s death, the Mongol Empire split up
1167 into four khanates. Chinggis’ grandson, Hulagu Khan, was ruler of the Il-Khanate.
1168 Since the Muslim states were divided, individually they were no match for the
1169 Mongol warriors. Hulagu conquered Persia, Syria and part of Anatolia and
1170 destroyed the Abbasid Caliphate’s capital of Baghdad. Although some feared
1171 that the Mongols would destroy the Muslim world, the Egyptian Mamluk
1172 Sultanate fought the Mongol army and stopped its advance. Mongols in the
1173 Khanate of the Golden Horde overran Russia and attacked Poland and Eastern
1174 Europe. The Khanate of the Great Khan went to another grandson, Kubilai Khan,
1175 who took over China from the Song dynasty. Kubilai established the Yuan
1176 dynasty and kept many Chinese customs, but replaced Confucian scholar-
1177 officials with foreign administrators. The Mongols conquered states in Southeast
1178 Asia and tried twice to invade Japan in the late thirteenth century, but failed both

1179 times. The domination of the Mongols did not last long; three of the four Mongol
1180 khanates fell by 100 years after the conquest.
1181 Although the Mongols killed many people and destroyed many cities in its
1182 conquest, after the conquest, the Mongols tolerated all religions and protected
1183 and promoted trade across Eurasia. Under their protection, the land trade route
1184 from China to the Mediterranean re-opened and trade boomed. The Mongols
1185 also moved people around throughout their empire, using, for example, Persian
1186 and Arab administrators in China, and facilitating the journey of Marco Polo (and
1187 many other less famous people) from Venice to China. The increase in
1188 interaction also spread Chinese technologies and ideas into the Muslim and
1189 Christian worlds. To understand both the negative and positive effects of the
1190 Mongol conquest and empire, student groups do a gallery walk with visuals of a
1191 Mongol passport, hunting scroll, gold textile, and a Persian tile with Chinese
1192 motifs, and an excerpt from Marco Polo describing the Mongolian postal service.
1193 Students cite evidence from each primary source on a source analysis template
1194 to answer the question: How did the Mongol Empire increase the
1195 interconnection of Afroeurasia?
1196 After the Mongol khanates fell, new states and empires arose. As the Il-
1197 Khanate declined, Turkish kingdoms replaced the Mongols. These Turkish
1198 warriors originally came from Central Asia, and spread into the Muslim world
1199 after their conversion to Islam. Combining dedication to religious ideas with the
1200 mounted warrior tradition of Central Asia, they took over the settled Muslim
1201 lands. In the west, Turkish armies took over most of Anatolia from the Byzantine 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
290
1202 Empire (a conquest which set off the Crusades). One of the Turkish leaders,
1203 Osman, created the Ottoman Empire in 1326. He and his successors conquered
1204 all of Anatolia, Greece, and most of the Balkan peninsula in eastern Europe,
1205 before conquering Constantinople in 1453 and bringing the Byzantine Empire to
1206 an end. Other Turkish dynasties took over Persia (the Safavids) and northern
1207 India (the Mughals). In China, the native Ming dynasty removed the Mongols and
1208 returned the administration of China’s government to Confucian scholar-officials.
1209 In the remainder of this unit, students with engage with this question: How
1210 did increasing interconnection and trade, competition between states (and
1211 their people), and technological innovations lead to voyages of
1212 exploration? Most states and empires supported trade as the rulers and elite
1213 groups wanted access to products such as silk from China, Persia, Syria, and
1214 Egypt; spices from India and Southeast Asia; cotton cloth from India and Egypt;
1215 and gold from West Africa. Kings and their officials also realized that trade made
1216 their states strong and increased their tax income. Some used their military
1217 power to take over trade centers that belonged to other states or to dominate
1218 trade routes. As trade connections, imperial expansion, and travel increased in
1219 Afroeurasia, both conflict and cooperation occurred at sites of encounter.
1220 Competition between states for land and resources and between the followers of
1221 different religions made many encounters violent. At the same time, people from
1222 different cultures found ways to cooperate so that they could trade and coexist.
1223 Of the major regions of Afroeurasia, medieval Christendom had one of the
1224 least developed but also one of the fastest growing economies. There were few 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
291
1225 European products that people in Asia and Africa wanted to buy, but there was a
1226 large and growing market in Europe for Asian spices, cloth, porcelain, and other
1227 goods. Europe had to export silver and gold to pay for these goods. Most of the
1228 silver ended up in China. Between about 1000 and 1300 CE, the ships and
1229 traders from Venice and Genoa rose to dominate long-distance commerce to
1230 Europe from Cairo and other Muslim trade cities in Southwestern Asia and North
1231 Africa. During the same time period, certain states of Western Christendom,
1232 notably England, France, Castile, and Aragon grew stronger and more
1233 centralized. The kings of Castile, Aragon, and other Christian kingdoms of Iberia
1234 fought against Muslim kingdoms of al-Andalus for both religious and political
1235 reasons. As a case study of Christian, Muslim and Jewish interaction in medieval
1236 Iberia, students analyze the site of encounter, Majorca, with the question: What
1237 were the effects of the exchanges at Majorca? King James I of Aragon
1238 conquered this island off the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula from its
1239 Muslim Almohad rulers in 1229. Students read excerpts from James’s
1240 Autobiography in a guided activity that teaches them how to cite evidence. They
1241 learn that James was motivated in part by Majorca’s position as a trading and
1242 shipping center for the western Mediterranean and the Maghribi ports, which
1243 controlled the gold trade from Mali. Catalan merchants urged James to take over
1244 Majorca because they wanted to gain access to those markets. On the Majorcan
1245 base and elsewhere in Iberia, Catalans, Genoese, Iberian Jews, Iberian Muslims
1246 (Moors), and Portuguese developed maps, such as the Catalan Atlas, ships, and
1247 navigational technology which gave Mediterranean shippers access to the 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
292
1248 Atlantic Ocean. Accessing the Catalan Atlas reproductions online, students
1249 closely examine this early map of Afroeurasia to identify its improved features,
1250 such as accurate coastlines and a compass rose. In a gallery walk, they analyze
1251 objects, such as the lateen sail and the astrolabe, adopted from the Islamic
1252 world, and the compass, invented in China, and visuals of medieval ships to
1253 identify the technological improvements. These examples demonstrate the
1254 synthesis of creative energies that a site of encounter often produces. Using this
1255 technology, Catalans and Portuguese began exploring the African coast (looking
1256 for a different route to the gold fields of West Africa). However, increasing
1257 intolerance of the Iberian Christian kingdoms to Jews and Muslims ended that
1258 multicultural society by 1500. In the “Investigative Reporting on Intolerance,”
1259 student groups read excerpts from al-Idrisi, Benjamin of Tudela, Ramon Llull, or
1260 Ferdinand and Isabella. Then the student group designs and acts out an
1261 investigative report (as for TV news or a cell phone I-Report). Each student in the
1262 group plays a role in the report, which can be videotaped, recorded on a cell
1263 phone, or acted out live. All reports are shown to the class, and students record
1264 specific information and evidence on a chart. The teacher concludes by pointing
1265 out that England, France, and other states also expelled Jews in this period.
1266 Tired of the persecution, many European Jews migrated to Poland, where the
1267 government gave them security and rights, Russia, and elsewhere in Eastern
1268 Europe.
1269 Next the students switch to a site of encounter in India, Calicut, a major trade
1270 center of the Indian Ocean trading network. As they explore the question: What 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
293
1271 were the effects of the exchanges at Calicut? students learn about both the
1272 fifteenth-century Indian Ocean trade and the advent of the Portuguese in 1498. In
1273 the “What’s so Hot about Spices?” activity, students examine written and visual
1274 primary sources about popular spices, where they were grown, and how they
1275 were used as flavorings, medicines, and perfumes. Using the Sites of Encounter
1276 in the Medieval World map, students study the Indian Ocean monsoon patterns
1277 and tables of medieval sailing seasons to determine the effects on ships,
1278 merchants, and sailors. Ships from many states visited Calicut, including Chinese
1279 junks and the huge fleets led by Admiral Zheng He. Between 1405 and 1433, the
1280 Ming emperor sent out enormous fleets of hundreds of ships on seven major
1281 voyages to trade and collect tribute in the Indian Ocean, advancing as far west
1282 as the Red Sea and East Africa. Although after 1433, the Ming emperors did not
1283 send out any more naval fleets, trade continued. In the “Analyzing Perspectives
1284 on Calicut and Trade” group activity, students read primary sources written by
1285 Arab travelers, Jewish merchants, Persian ambassadors, Chinese officers and
1286 explorers, and Portuguese explorers. Each group member chooses an equal
1287 share of the sources, which he or she reads aloud to the group and then guides a
1288 discussion, as everyone else fills out a source analysis chart. Students use the
1289 evidence to write an essay on the question: What were the effects of the
1290 exchanges at Calicut? The lesson has the writing prompt, instructions for
1291 evidence use, an effects organization chart, an evidence analysis chart, an essay
1292 frame, and a grading rubric. The teacher selects among these resources those
1293 that will support English Learners and struggling writers as appropriate.

294
1294 To conclude, the teacher returns to central question: How did increasing
1295 interconnection and trade, competition between states (and their people),
1296 and technological innovations lead to voyages of exploration? He or she
1297 asks students to identify examples of each of these causes from Majorca and
1298 Calicut. Comparison of the voyages of Zheng He with those of Columbus and/or
1299 Da Gama makes a good transition to the next unit.

1313 This unit begins with the question: What impact did human expansion in
1314 the voyages of exploration have on the environment, trade networks, and
1315 global interconnection? In the last unit, students investigated the state of
1316 Afroeurasian trade and power before the voyages of exploration and the 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
295
1317 technological developments in ships and navigation that enabled the European
1318 voyages. They examined the Chinese voyages of exploration led by Zheng He
1319 and the initial Portuguese voyages around Africa to India and Calicut. Now they
1320 turn to the Spanish and Portuguese voyages across the Atlantic begun by
1321 Columbus. As a result of these voyages, new oceanic routes connected nearly
1322 every inhabited part of the world. The Early Modern Period witnessed greater
1323 global connection and exchange, as European conquests and encounters in the
1324 Americas linked both hemispheres in significant ways.
1325 People, plants, and animals were introduced to places where they had
1326 previously been unknown. This “Columbian Exchange” led to profound changes
1327 in economies, diets, social organization, and, in the Americas, to a massive
1328 devastation of Indian populations because of exposure to new disease
1329 microorganisms originating in Afroeurasia. The Columbian Exchange marks the
1330 important biological exchange of disease, flora, and fauna between both
1331 hemispheres. Students investigate the transfers of American crops such as
1332 maize, potatoes, and manioc to Afroeurasia, as well as addictive substances
1333 such as tobacco and chocolate. From Afroeurasia, the Americas acquired
1334 horses, cows, pigs, and sheep. Introduction of new staple crops helped increase
1335 the population in much of Afroeurasia, and the imported animals and plants
1336 transformed the landscapes of the Americas. The Colombian Exchange also
1337 occurred across the Pacific Ocean: American crops transplanted to China grew
1338 the Chinese economy, while the chili pepper sent to Southeast Asia affected food
1339 preparation, the economy, and culture. The diffusion of Afroeurasian diseases to 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
296
1340 the Americas had catastrophic demographic consequences. The mortality of as
1341 much as 90% of Native American population allowed European newcomers to
1342 conquer territories in the Americas. Migration by Europeans and forced migration
1343 of Africans to the Americas led to a radically different population mix and the
1344 emergence of new hybrid populations and cultures. Africans enslaved and forced
1345 to migrate outnumbered Europeans in the Americas until the nineteenth century.
1346 The loss of so many people caused severe economic and demographic
1347 disruption in tropical Africa. The effects of the Columbian Exchange were
1348 profound environmental change and huge human population shifts.
1349 European voyages to the Americas and the Indian Ocean transformed world
1350 trade networks. The Spanish extracted precious metals, gold and especially
1351 silver, and the Portuguese, Dutch, French, and English extracted raw materials,
1352 such as lumber and furs, from their American colonies and shipped them to
1353 Afroeurasia. Europeans set up plantations to grow cash crops that were exported
1354 to Afroeurasia. The result was a massive influx of wealth into Europe. However,
1355 Asia remained the world’s most productive center of agriculture and
1356 manufacturing until near the end of this era. Chinese products were so highly
1357 desired in the European market that a substantial portion of the silver taken from
1358 the New World ended up in China as payment for Chinese products exported to
1359 Europe. European states and merchants also took over the shipping of products
1360 around the world’s oceans and seas, gradually replacing the merchant fleets of
1361 other regions. These European states frequently battled with each other to
1362 dominate shipping routes, trade cities, and lands with desirable resources. The 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft

297
1363 Portuguese battled Indian, Arab, and Southeast Asian shippers in the Indian
1364 Ocean, but the Portuguese were soon themselves attacked and replaced by the
1365 Dutch, who took over the spice islands of Southeast Asia. French and English
1366 fleets and pirates battled Spanish fleets in the Atlantic and Pacific. Ocean trade
1367 expanded and became more militarized as the Europeans took over shipping.
1368 Students analyze maps to see how the more important voyages of exploration
1369 led to the development of global trading patterns and the location of European
1370 colonies by 1750.
1371 Next students investigate the question: Why did the Europeans use
1372 colonialism to interact with Native Americans and some Southeast Asians?
1373 What were the effects of colonialism on the colonized people? It’s important
1374 for students to recognize that the Europeans did not take over China, India,
1375 Africa, and most of Asia until the nineteenth century. For this entire period,
1376 therefore, the major Afroeurasian centers – China, India, and the Islamic World –
1377 were too strong for Europeans to conquer. In lands where states were not as
1378 strong, Europeans established colonies. European armies used gunpowder
1379 weapons to defeat local resistance. Europeans became the government rulers
1380 and officials and changed the laws. They also took desirable land away from the
1381 native owners and gave it to Europeans. Often the Europeans used the land to
1382 grow tropical commercial crops for sale in Afroeurasia. Sometimes the European
1383 government and army forced the native people to work for the Europeans as
1384 well. Finally, European Christian missionaries spread through the colonies trying
1385 to convert local people to Christianity. Some states, such as Spain and Portugal, 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
298
1386 supported these missionaries and helped to force local people to change their
1387 religion; other states, such as the Netherlands, did not pay much attention to
1388 missionary activities. The teacher uses a guided discussion format to address the
1389 question: Why did the Europeans use colonialism to interact with Native
1390 Americans and some Southeast Asians? Students brainstorm possible
1391 motives of Europeans and weigh the relative importance of power, wealth,
1392 competition with other European states, and religion, using a discussion guide
1393 with sentence starters modeling academic language. As a group, students rank
1394 the possible motives and explain their reasons, and each student individually
1395 writes a one-sentence interpretation (argument or claim) answering the question.
1396 The teacher emphasizes that although many states had conquered sites of
1397 encounter in the past, colonialism was a new form of interaction between cultures
1398 that was unequal and exploitative.
1399 In addition to conquering areas where there were divisions among many
1400 states, such as Sumatra, Java, Malaysia, and the Philippines, or where there
1401 were no states, such as the Caribbean islands, Spanish conquerors took over
1402 both the Aztec and Inca empires in the early sixteenth century. Students assess
1403 explanations that historians have given for their defeat at the hands of small
1404 numbers of Europeans. Two key factors aided European military efforts. The first
1405 was the introduction of infectious diseases, such as smallpox and measles,
1406 which were endemic in Africa and Eurasia, but against which American Indian
1407 populations lacked even partial immunities. These diseases began to ravage
1408 societies in both North and South America shortly after the Spanish invasions got 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
299
1409 underway. The second factor was Spanish success at allying with local groups,
1410 notably the Tlaxcalans, who wished to free themselves from Aztec rule. In the
1411 California EEI Curriculum Unit “Broken Jade and Tarnished Gold,” students learn
1412 that the Spanish needed the natural resources of the region, with a goal of
1413 sustaining their own economic and political systems in the “Old World.” They
1414 explore many human social factors including greed, religious fervor, and disease
1415 that left the Spanish in control of vast lands in Central and South America,
1416 eventually propelling the empire to expand into the lands to the north, including
1417 California.
Grade Seven Classroom Example: The Spanish Conquest of Mexico
To assess the impact of the Spanish conquest, Mr. Brown’s students return to
the question: What were effects of exchanges at Tenochtitlán/Mexico City in
the 16th through 18th centuries? The students begin by analyzing images of the
conquest and interactions between Spanish and Aztecs/Mexica, which can be
found in the image exercises in the “Conquest of Mexico” materials at the
American Historical Association’s Teaching and Learning in a Digital Age
website.
After Mr. Brown explains how to analyze perspective or point of view, student
pairs source the images and identify evidence of exchanges, effects of
exchanges, and perspective. As they share their evidence, Mr. Brown guides and
refines their understanding of perspective or point of view. Next they engage in a
close reading of excerpts from accounts of the conquest and its early impact from 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft

the Letters of Cortés, the True History of Díaz del Castillo, Broken Spears, the
Florentine Codex, and the Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies by De
Las Casas. (Excerpts in English and Spanish from all of these works are readily
available on the web, except for Broken Spears, collection of Aztec writings
about the conquest that was originally written in Nahautl and recently edited and
translated into English.) Sometimes Mr. Brown has all students read every
document; other times he divides the documents between student groups. (The
most effective division would have students read one Spanish account and one
Aztec account that addressed the same event or topic.)
Each student reads the document individually first, and then discusses the
question: What is this reading about? with a partner. In the second reading,
students fill out a sentence deconstruction chart that breaks down the most
crucial sentence or sentences of the text, complete a worksheet that helps them
identify unfamiliar vocabulary in context, and then answer text-dependent
questions. For the third reading, the students mark up and annotate the text,
using cognitive markers (for exchanges, effects of exchanges, loaded words,
evidence of perspective or point of view, questions).
After reading all the documents, students meet in groups, identify the
exchanges and effects of exchanges and cite evidence for each on an effects
analysis graphic organizer. As Mr. Brown displays the graphic organizer of
several groups on the elmo, he or she helps students group together common
exchanges, state their points in academic language, and understand any unclear

points. Students investigate examples of the hybrid nature of Colonial Latin
America and assess the contributions of native peoples to the cultural, economic,
and social practices of the region by 1750. (Two concrete examples of this are
the building of the Mexico City cathedral on the location of the central pyramid,
as well as other changes to the spatial geography of Mexico City, and the Virgin
of Guadalupe. Seventeenth-century Dutch, English, and French conquest and
colonization in the Caribbean and North America are introduced and can be
compared with developments in Latin America.)

1419 Next students investigate the transport of African slaves to the Americas and
1420 the creation of racialized slavery with the question: Was slavery always racial?
1421 The teacher refers back to examples of slavery in the ancient and medieval
1422 world, such as Rome, where slaves belonged to all ethnic groups and were
1423 usually captives in war. In the medieval Mediterranean, Christians and Muslims
1424 enslaved captives who did not belong to their own religions. However, slavery
1425 was not necessarily for life, and the children of slaves were not always slaves
1426 themselves. In the Americas and the trade circuit scholars call the Atlantic World,
1427 European slave-traders imported kidnapped Africans to work on plantations and

1428 mines in response to shortages of Indian labor in the Americas. Since relatively
1429 few Europeans wished to migrate to the Americas to perform grueling labor in
1430 tropical climates, European planters and mine operators turned to western Africa
1431 to acquire large numbers of enslaved men and women and thereby have the
1432 labor for large-scale capitalist enterprises in the Americas. Teachers may also
1433 highlight the role played by African leaders such as Queen Nzinga from Angola in
1434 this increasingly global exchange. In the Americas, slavery became racialized
1435 and Europeans began to cultivate the idea that Africans were lesser people who
1436 were supposed to be enslaved. Students analyze visuals of the Middle Passage
1437 and maps of the Atlantic World trade routes and the numbers of slaves who were
1438 transported to the Caribbean and Brazil, which vastly outnumbered those who
1439 were transported to the Thirteen Colonies. Attention to these points will prepare
1440 students for studying colonial economies and slavery in Grade 8. Africans took
1441 part in the world economy in ways that profited rulers and traders but that caused
1442 misery for millions. The forced removal of millions of people also had severe
1443 economic and demographic consequences in tropical Africa.
1444 The final question of this unit is: How did the gunpowder empires
1445 (Ming/Manchu China, Mughal India, Safavid Persia, Ottoman Empire,
1446 Russia, Spain, later France and England) extend their power over people
1447 and territories? Wide-scale use of gunpowder technology – cannon and
1448 firearms – transformed warfare and armies. Since these weapons were so
1449 expensive, only states could afford them. Gunpowder technology revolutionized
1450 warfare and enabled the power of the central state or empire to expand greatly. 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft

303
1451 With firearms, state armies could dominate internal rivals and decimate larger
1452 armies that had no firearms. As a result, some states built large gunpowder
1453 empires using the power of the new technology. These gunpowder empires,
1454 which included Spain, Russia, Ming China, the Mughal Empire in India, the
1455 Safavids in Persia, and the Ottoman Empire, were able to dominate weaker
1456 polities and expand their territories. In England, France, Japan under the
1457 Tokugawa Shogunate, and many other smaller states, rulers used the power of
1458 their armies to deprive feudal lords of their local power and centralize authority in
1459 their own hands. As a result, states became more centralized and governments
1460 grew stronger. Gunpowder empires and states used their armies to attack other
1461 states as well. For example, in the sixteenth century, Ottoman armies attacked
1462 the Austrian Empire, Hungary, and Poland. French and English armies and
1463 navies fought wars against the Spanish and Austrian Habsburg empires.

1465 The Impact of Ideas, 1500-1750
1466 • How did the Reformation divide the Christian Church, millions of people,
1467 and European states?
1468 • How did world religions change and spread during the early modern
1469 period?
1470 • What were the effects of the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution?
1471 • How were the social contract and other political ideas of the
1472 Enlightenment revolutionary?
1473 This unit investigates religious, cultural, and intellectual changes in the period 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
304
1474 from 1500 to 1750. Students see the impact of new information flowing into
1475 Europe from the “discoveries” in the Americas as a more critical factor in
1476 reshaping European thought than the cultural movement of the Renaissance.
1477 While the Reformation was a critically important development in Christianity,
1478 other world religions continued to change and spread in this period as well. To
1479 reflect this new historiography, this unit focuses on two strands, religion and
1480 cultural and intellectual developments, both in the world context. Rewriting of this
1481 unit also addresses the problem of teaching abstract concepts to seventh-
1482 graders in May and June. It streamlines the content to focus on the most
1483 important developments and recommends activities that will engage students as
1484 well as challenge them.
1485 To introduce the Reformation, the teacher reminds students that there was
1486 only one Church in Western Europe, headed by the Pope in Rome, but that there
1487 were other Christian churches elsewhere, such as the Orthodox churches. In the
1488 1500s, Roman Christianity split into multiple denominations. Students will focus
1489 on the question: How did the Reformation divide the Christian Church,
1490 millions of people, and European states? By the early sixteenth century,
1491 criticism of the clerical and institutional practices of the Catholic Church (e.g., the
1492 selling of indulgences and corruption by the clergy) was extensive. Martin Luther
1493 not only criticized these practices, but also fundamental doctrines such as the
1494 validity of five of the seven sacraments and the need for clergy and good works
1495 to achieve salvation. He created a new theology that Christian religious practice
1496 be strictly guided by knowledge from within the Bible alone and that salvation 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
305
1497 was justified by ‘faith alone.’ Students can analyze Martin Luther’s account of his
1498 tower experience, using the excerpt, sentence deconstruction chart, and analysis
1499 chart on the Blueprint for History blogpost “Martin Luther Primary Source and
1500 CCSS Activity.” A generation later, John Calvin argued for predestination,
1501 whereby those elected by God were certain of salvation. The distinctions
1502 between Lutheranism and Calvinism were significant and led to many separate
1503 denominations within Protestantism. Students examine a diagram showing how
1504 modern Christian churches descended from these original splits in Protestantism.
1505 The Catholic Reformation in response to Protestantism transformed the Roman
1506 Church as well, especially in its practices. All churches stressed education,
1507 understanding of doctrine, and social discipline for lay people.
1508 The Reformation had dramatic effects on European people. All of the new
1509 denominations, Catholic and Protestant, were intolerant of each other and would
1510 not allow believers from another denomination to coexist with their believers.
1511 Mobs of ordinary people sometimes fought over religious differences. The rulers
1512 of states chose one denomination and required all the people living in the state to
1513 belong to that denomination. For example, if Calvinists found themselves living in
1514 a Lutheran state, they had either to hide their belief or move to another country.
1515 The threat of Protestantism added more fuel to the already growing religious
1516 persecution in Spain, which had expelled the Jews in 1492. Spain expelled all
1517 Muslims between 1500 and 1614 and persecuted converts and dissenters in the
1518 Spanish Inquisition. Spanish identity became associated with Roman Catholic
1519 belief and a strong sense of the Spanish mission to protect and spread it, which 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
306
1520 showed also in the strenuous and successful efforts of the Spanish to convert the
1521 local people in their Latin American colonies and the Philippines. Protestant
1522 states were also intolerant and executed Catholics and members of other
1523 Protestant denominations. In addition, state authorities executed 50,000 people,
1524 ¾ of them women, as witches who had sworn loyalty to the devil.
1525 Whereas the Catholic Church insisted that priests and nuns remain celibate
1526 (unmarried), the new Protestant churches permitted their clergy to marry. In a
1527 few radical Protestant sects, women sometimes became leaders in church
1528 organization and propagation. However, male clergy, both Catholic and
1529 Protestant, generally agreed that even though men and women are equal in the
1530 sight of God women should bow to the will of their fathers and husbands in
1531 religious and intellectual matters.
1532 Religious differences shaped European divisions for the rest of the early
1533 modern era. Most of northwestern Europe, such as England, the Netherlands,
1534 the northern German lands, and Scandinavia, became Protestant, while most of
1535 southwestern Europe, such as France, Spain, the southern German lands, and
1536 Italy, remained loyal to Rome. Religious differences led to wars between Spain
1537 and England, the revolt of the Netherlands, the Huguenot civil wars in France,
1538 and the Thirty Years War in Germany, which ended in 1648. By that time, after
1539 150 years of religious warfare, many Europeans were calling for religious
1540 toleration to bring an end to religious violence.
1541 Students now turn to the question: How did world religions change and
1542 spread during the early modern period? The expansion of global 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
307
1543 communications facilitated the further expansion of major world religions, notably
1544 Christianity in the Americas and Southeast Asia, Islam around the Indian Ocean
1545 rim, and Theravada Buddhism from Sri Lanka to Southeast Asia. The Christian
1546 reformation played a significant role in motivating colonization of the Americas.
1547 European missionaries, especially Catholic missionary orders, spread reformed
1548 Christianity in Africa and Asia during the early modern period.
1549 A new world religion, Sikhism, was founded in 1469 in South Asia. Sikhism
1550 was founded by Guru Nanak, a social reformer who challenged the authority of
1551 the Brahmins and the caste order. Students learn about the Sikh Scripture (Guru
1552 Granth Sahib), articles of faith, the turban, and Sikh history. Guru Nanak taught
1553 that all human beings are equal and can realize the divine within them without
1554 any human intermediaries or priests. Sikhs believe that each individual can
1555 realize the divine on his or her own through devotion to God, truthful living, and
1556 service to humanity. The three basic principles of Sikhism are honest living,
1557 sharing with the needy, and praying to one God. With the addition of Sikhism,
1558 there were now four major religions of indigenous origin. While relations between
1559 people of different religions were often peaceful, generally, most Muslim rulers
1560 persecuted Sikhs as well as Hindus and Jains. Other Mughal rulers, most notably
1561 Akbar, encouraged and accelerated the blending of Hindu and Islamic beliefs as
1562 well as architectural and artistic forms.
1563 Religious enthusiasm and challenge to orthodoxy in the early modern period
1564 was not unique to Europe. In China the philosopher Wang Yangming (1472-
1565 1529) initiated a reform of neo-Confucian teaching and practice, which he found 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
308
1566 dogmatic and snobbish. He argued that ordinary women and men have the
1567 capacity to lead honest lives and know good from evil without learning Confucian
1568 texts and performing ceremonies. In Iran, the Safavid Dynasty gave support to
1569 the Shi’a branch of Islam, thereby challenging Sunni authority. For another
1570 example of adoption and adaptation, students can analyze art and texts from
1571 Java to see how the journey of nine Sufi saints led to a synthesis of local
1572 animism, Hinduism and Islam. On a global scale, religious change in the early
1573 modern period tended to promote more personal forms of practice at the
1574 expense of the power of entrenched religious institutions and clerics. Religions
1575 continued to spread as people sought ways to understand the changes
1576 happening around them.
1577 The teacher makes the transition to the question: What were the effects of
1578 the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution? by telling students that they
1579 will be studying the development and spread of other sets of ideas besides
1580 religious ones. The Renaissance was a cultural and intellectual movement that
1581 began in the Italian city-states in the mid-fourteenth century and spread across
1582 Europe by the sixteenth century.
1583 The Italian Peninsula witnessed significant urbanization and the formation of
1584 prosperous independent city-states such as Venice, Genoa, Florence and Milan.
1585 With wealth generated from trade and industry, and inspired by commercial and
1586 political rivalry with one another, these city-states experienced a remarkable
1587 burst of creativity that produced the artistic and literary advances of the
1588 Renaissance. Through extensive contact with Byzantine and Islamic scholars, a

309
1589 considerable body of Greco-Roman knowledge was rediscovered. This revival of
1590 classical learning was named humanism. Humanists studied history, moral
1591 philosophy, poetry, rhetoric, and grammar, subjects they thought should be the
1592 key elements of an enlightened education. Humanism facilitated considerable
1593 achievements in literature, such as the works of Dante Alighieri, Machiavelli, and
1594 William Shakespeare, and the arts, such the painting and sculpture of Leonardo
1595 da Vinci and Michelangelo di Buonarroti Simoni. Students investigate the
1596 Renaissance artistic techniques, such as perspective and realistic portraits, and
1597 architectural masterpieces, such as the Sistine Chapel. After 1455, the printing
1598 press, using moveable metal type, and the availability of manufactured paper
1599 disseminated humanism and Italian Renaissance learning to other parts of
1600 Europe and beyond. In Northern Europe, humanist interest in the origin and
1601 development of languages inspired the creation of new and more exacting Greek
1602 and Latin versions of the New Testament as well as vernacular translations of the
1603 Bible. This emphasis on exact reading of the Christian scriptures was an
1604 important influence upon early Protestant thinkers.
1605 Humanism played a continuing role in advancing science, mathematics, and
1606 engineering techniques, as well as the understanding of human anatomy and
1607 astronomy. Discoveries led to a Scientific Revolution in early modern Europe.
1608 The long-term origins of the Scientific Revolution were rooted in the historical
1609 connections with Greco-Roman rationalism; Jewish, Christian, and Muslim
1610 science; and Renaissance humanism. European exploration and colonization in
1611 this period also stimulated a desire for intellectual understanding of the human 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
310
1612 and natural world. New information, new plants, and new animals from the
1613 Americas, which were not mentioned in the Bible nor by Aristotle and other
1614 ancient Greek authorities, led many to challenge traditional Christian and
1615 classical ideas about the universe. Scientists replaced reliance on classical
1616 authorities with the methodologies of the Scientific Revolution: empiricism,
1617 scientific observation, mathematical proof, and experimental science. They
1618 created what is today known as the scientific method. A number of significant
inventions and instruments in over the 16th and 17th 1619 centuries—the telescope,
1620 microscope, thermometer, and barometer— furthered scientific knowledge and
1621 understanding. There were significant scientific theories in astronomy and
1622 physics, including those associated with Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler,
1623 Sir Isaac Newton, and Galileo Galilei (a physicist and astronomer who was
1624 charged with heresy by the Catholic Church for his public support of Copernicus’
1625 theory that the earth revolved around the sun; he spent his final days under
1626 house arrest).
1627 By the eighteenth century, scientific thinking and rational thought in Europe
1628 were reconciled with religious ideas and practice, as scientists justified their
1629 studies as identifying the patterns of the natural world to discover the plan of the
1630 divine. Many people accepted the concept that the universe operates according
1631 to natural laws, which human reason can discover and explain. The development
1632 of a culture of scientific inquiry in Europe was associated with its autonomous
1633 universities in some countries. In these institutions scholars received some legal
1634 protection and were relatively free to study and argue what they pleased. 
History–Social Science Framework Second Field Review Draft
Approved by the Instructional Quality Commission November 20, 2015
311
1635 Gradually, European scientific knowledge began to inform military, agricultural,
1636 and metallurgical technologies. By the early eighteenth century, this culture of
1637 scientific inquiry was diffused beyond Europe through the establishment of
1638 universities in Mexico, Peru, and North America. The teacher sets up a gallery
1639 walk of major inventions and discoveries of the Scientific Revolution and gives
1640 students a source analysis chart that includes the questions: What were the
1641 effects of the Scientific Revolution? What modern ideas or technologies
1642 came from this invention or discovery? When students have completed
1643 gallery walk, the teacher leads a discussion of the effects of the Scientific
1644 Revolution, and lists effects on the board as students identify them.
1645 Newton’s recognition that nature was understandable, predictable, and bound
1646 by natural laws proved an important inspiration to Locke and other early thinkers
1647 associated with the Enlightenment who argued that such laws and
1648 understandings were applicable to the human and moral world as well. The
1649 Enlightenment emerged from the Scientific Revolution, and the political and
social conditions of the 18th 1650 century. The students focus on the question: Why
1651 were the social contract and other ideas of the Enlightenment
1652 revolutionary? Beginning in the late seventeenth century, philosophers began to
1653 employ the use of reason and scientific methods to scrutinize previously
1654 accepted political and social doctrines. Enlightenment thinkers, such as John
1655 Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Charles-Louis Montesquieu, and Thomas
1656 Jefferson, proposed religious toleration, equal rights of all before the law, and the
1657 Social Contract. The teacher focuses on the social contract, as it provides the

312
1658 necessary bridge to Grade 8. After explaining its three fundamental concepts, the
1659 teacher assigns a choice project: students can either write a story, draw a visual,
1660 or act out the three ideas of the social contract. Students work alone on stories or
1661 visuals, but form small groups for the acting option. The students can also
1662 engage in a service learning project that emphasizes the importance of the
1663 responsibility of citizens in a democracy. If the people are the basis of the state,
1664 then they must act to protect the state and other citizens, participate in state
1665 institutions, such as jury duty and voting, and help insure rights for all.
